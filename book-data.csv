Coulter,Hardcover,Skyhorse,"November 25, 2025",978-1510785281,"<p>First published in 1990, <em>Medical Assault on the American Brain</em> ignited fierce debate with its unflinching examination of the long-term consequences of routine childhood vaccination.

The Sofa,Recommended Books,,Sam Munson,Paperback,Two Dollar Radio,"November 11, 2025",978-1953387974,"<p><strong>Kafkaesque slow-burn domestic horror from a master of the uncanny.</strong><br /> <br /> Mr. Montessori and his family return home from a trip to the beach to discover that their sofa is different. Once dark and contemporary, it’s now antique, green and yellow, and smelling faintly of damp.</p><p>Its appearance and origins are a mystery. A joke? An inverted theft? A break in the fabric of reality? Yes, the police take the “crime” seriously. But what happens next lies outside their expertise. Strange sounds in the night. A half-bathroom toilet with a mind of its own. Odd, fleeting glimpses of something (or someone) in mirrors. The inexplicable vision of Montessori’s neighbor: He swears he saw a burglar. . . .</p><p>Montessori’s quest for answers will take him to a dank highway overpass in decayed upstate New York, a very strange dry-cleaning supply concern in outermost Queens, and into the depths of an eerie, warped forest where time and space no longer connect, all while putting his ever-more-troubled marriage and young family in grave danger. But that’s what it costs to find out if we own our possessions — or if they own us.</p><p>Munson emerges as a master stylist in this tense, taut work of surreal humor and psychological horror.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sgb9DUhcL._SL1500_.jpg

Now, in the highly acclaimed and award-winning <em>Winter Stories</em>, Rishøi paints three vivid and evocative portraits of the lives of those existing on the fringes of society.</p><p>A young mother in financial trouble tries to steal a pair of underwear in front of the watchful eyes of her young daughter. A man fresh out of prison struggles to reintegrate into a daunting society and become a better father to his son. Three siblings run away and seek refuge in a remote cabin untouched by time in a desperate bid to keep their family from being torn apart. In these powerful and emotionally charged tales, Rishøi delves into the complexities of family, poverty, and forgiveness, exploring the human desire for a better life, the longing for change, and the difficult choices we must sometimes make to protect those we love.</p><p><em>Winter Stories</em> is a masterful triptych from a major international writer renowned for her ability to say a great deal in few words. It is a poignant reminder of the power of hope, loyalty, and unexpected kindness during dark times.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818dnvR-AvL._SL1500_.jpg

The Last Men: Liberalism and the Death of Masculinity,Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,Dr. Charles Cornish-Dale,Hardcover,Regnery,"December 16, 2025",978-1510786783,"<p>Whatever one’s politics, it’s probably a good idea to pay attention to the sort of Oxford-educated historian and anthropologist, Dr. Charles Cornish-Dale, who’s been lionized by both Tucker Carlson and <em>Vanity Fair. </em>The place to start is Cornish-Dale’s book <em>The Last Men: Liberalism and the Death of Masculinity. </em>Don’t be put off by its origin story, a provocative reinterpretation of Francis Fukuyama’s <em>The End of History and the Last Man</em>, the visionary study of humankind as it enters the age of ecstatically impotent paradise, biologically engineered by the triumph of liberal democracy.</p><p>But who or what <em>is</em> this Last Man?</p><p>He’s what’s left at the “end of history,” when we lose sight of the unique ambitions, sometimes of otherness and separation from our fellows, that are our birthright. When physical and economic needs are satisfied, can there be a so-called higher purpose?

In Fukuyama’s own words, with the fall of Communism in Europe, mankind had reached, “not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution, and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.”</p><p>To many after September 11, the Global War on Terror, the rise of China and the Migrant Crisis of 2015, and with the “Climate Crisis” supposedly about to make large swathes of the planet literally uninhabitable for human life, Fukuyama’s pronouncement of the End of History was premature, to say the least.</p><p>Big things are very much still happening.</p><p>Of course, if you’ve taken the time to read Fukuyama, you’ll know he wasn’t saying that history—i.e., the onward progression of time and events—had ceased. Nobody, not even a Harvard political scientist, could be that dumb. Rather, Fukuyama believed the evolution of social and political forms—a process which, like Marx and Hegel, he saw as developing in a linear fashion by means of contradictions and clashes—had finally come to an end. By defeating communism, liberal capitalist democracy had shown once and for all its superiority as a way of ordering life. Based on what we know about politics, economics, and ethics—and about man himself—nothing better could ever come along. And although there might be regressions, moments when the totalitarian impulses of the mid-20th century returned, these would always prove temporary. Liberal capitalist democracy would win again.</p><p>Always.</p><p><br /> <strong><em>In Search of the Last Men</em></strong></p><p>The basics of Fukuyama’s thesis are apt to be misrepresented, and Fukuyama himself is often made to serve as a straw man for the Western liberal elite and its monumental hubris, but other parts of his thesis are missed altogether. The title of his book is popularly known as <em>The End of History</em>. In fact, the full title is <em>The End of History and the Last Man</em>. This omission from the general consciousness is telling. Because not only is the book a proclamation of victory, it is also a warning—a warning that takes up the final fifth of the book. A warning about the Last Man.</p><p>Who or what is this Last Man?</p><p>In simple terms, the Last Man is what you get at the End of History, when there’s no longer anything particularly important worth living for. When the great ethical, economic and political questions have all been settled, what higher purposes exist for men to strive towards? The answer is: none. Life becomes dull not through any individual defect but on a metaphysical level.</p><p><br /> <strong><em>The Changing Place of </em>Thymos</strong></p><p>Megalothymia, a Greek word, is key here. <em>Thymos</em>, according to the Greeks, was the part of an individual’s soul that desires recognition or dignity. The word could be translated as something approximating “spiritedness” or “warm-bloodedness.” It’s an attribute all men possess and can develop. Fukuyama explains how Plato “compares a man with thymos to a noble dog who is capable of great courage and anger fighting strangers in defense of his own city.” <em>Thymos </em>can be equated, in some sense, with what might today be called “self-esteem.” As Fukuyama puts it, “<em>Thymos </em>is something like an innate sense of justice: people believe that they have a certain worth, and when other people act as though they are worthless—when they do not <em>recognize </em>their worth at its correct value—then they become angry.”</p><p><em>Thymos</em>, then, is intimately tied to a person’s place in the social order, to his sense of self-worth (which must be reflected in others), and to his desire, ultimately, to assert his claim to these things. Fukuyama generally describes <em>thymos </em>as the “desire for recognition.”</p><p>The Greeks believed <em>thymos </em>came in various forms. There was <em>isothymia</em>, a desire to be acknowledged as equal to everybody else, which can be seen as the central impulse at the heart of the Christian and democratic ideals. Then there was <em>megalothymia</em>, which is the desire to seek distinction above others, in opposition to <em>isothymia</em>.</p><p>In the liberal-democratic end-state, where all men have been decided, at last, to be equal, <em>isothymia </em>is satisfied, but <em>megalothymia </em>is not and cannot be. Ever. And that’s not good.</p><p>In <em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em>, Sigmund Freud cautioned that when an entire population has unfulfilled or even deliberately suppressed desires, turmoil will follow. This is the crux of Fukuyama’s warning about the End of History: man’s nature cannot be denied. While it’s entirely possible that man will be happy now as one among many billions of equals, each pursuing his own limited goals like making money, buying things, having sex, and going on holidays, it’s equally possible that man—or rather <em>some </em>men—will rebel in the name of satisfying their desire to be different. To be better. What we might see instead of a future of cattle-like dolts enjoying an easy contentment is “immense wars of the spirit”—and Fukuyama means, quite literally, <em>wars</em>—with wild men letting loose and painting the world red again in the name of personal glory and some higher purpose what-ever that might be—that is, anything other than endless, monotonous peace and sex and commerce.</p><p>This is the scenario dramatized by the French writer Michel Houellebecq in his second novel <em>Platform</em>, where a self-satisfied French sex tourist, having reconciled himself to a life of hedonism on the beaches of Thailand, is caught up in a violent Islamic terrorist attack that kills his partner and eventually drives him to suicide.</p><p><em>Isothymia</em>, say hello to your old friend <em>megalothymia</em>!</p><p><br /> <strong><em>Not with a Bang but a Whimper?</em></strong></p><p>So what began as a supposedly ringing and uncomplicated endorsement of liberal democratic capitalism by Fukuyama has ended with a dire warning about the degeneration of man in a social prison of his own making and the desperate attempts he might make to free himself from it at any cost. Whatever Fukuyama’s original intention, <em>The End of History </em>offers one of the most devastating criticisms not only of the democratic form but of the forces that are making life hostile on a planetary scale to the human spirit. Although I don’t agree that liberal democratic capitalism is the end stage of man’s social and political development, I do agree the “unipolar moment” that followed the fall of communism in Europe was a hollow victory, and that, so long as liberalism is in the ascendant, man—and specifically <em>men</em>—are going to continue to suffer from a profound crisis of meaning and purpose.</p>",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NiNbnigQK0_OrmcoZGKTwHgq44buQf5G
