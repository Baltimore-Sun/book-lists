The director knew I had recently become a consultant for Arcade Publishing, a house that was acquired by the maverick Tony Lyon’s Skyhorse Publishing. (Arcade was founded by the man who discovered Samuel Beckett in Europe and brought Beckett to Grove Press; Arcade also put out works by Octavio Paz and E. M. Cioran.) I told him to send it. I loved <em>The Agonies</em>. Or rather, was astonished by it. The bildungs- roman naturally reminded of Salinger—but eclipsing that touchstone was the idiosyncratic, unpredictable, challengingly simple, gorgeous novel-mosaics created by a towering genius of our time, the Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard. Faulkner’s prose continuously startled and provoked, which was a miracle in itself. <em>The Agonies</em> is a fearless, poetic gestalt, a New Wave bellwether with the same feel as Bernhard, who, for me, is one of the rare—very rare—handful of authors that are sui generis. In other words, those who cannot be born nor die nor be replaced. Among them are Celine, Genet, and Ben’s namesake, that other Faulkner, William. I was dou- bly shocked because I had begun to be of the mind that I would never be surprised by the work of a millennial. Forgive me if that sounds arrogant, but at seventy-one, I’ve been around and share the cynicism of my contemporaries. For many of us, American novels have become incestuous—rooted in the cringe echo chambers of academia and careful not to offend. Ben Faulkner doesn’t offend; his existence is offensive in itself. How lucky we are to be so rudely, gloriously awakened from our sleep.","Arcade Publishing (March 25, 2025)"
