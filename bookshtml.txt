From his breakout role as Dr. Frank-N-Furter in <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show </em>to his iconic depiction as the sadistic clown Pennywise in <em>It </em>to his critically acclaimed role as the original King Arthur in both the Broadway and West End versions of <em>Spamalot, </em>Curry redefined what it meant to be a “character actor,” portraying heroes and villains alike with complexity, nuance, and a genuine understanding of human darkness.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Now, in his memoir, Curry takes readers behind-the-scenes of his rise to fame from his early beginnings as a military brat to his formative years in boarding school and university, to the moment when he hit the stage for the first time. He goes in-depth about what it was like to work on some of the most emblematic works of the 20th century, constantly switching between a camera and a live audience. He also explores the voicework that defined his later career and provided him with a chance to pivot after surviving a catastrophic stroke in 2012 that nearly took his life.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>With the upcoming 50th anniversary of <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show </em>and the 40th anniversary of <em>Clue, </em>there’s never been a better time for Tim to share his story with the world.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781250408150' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='The Irish Goodbye: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81muvCFTetL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781250408150' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>The Irish Goodbye: A Novel</a></strong><br>Heather Aimee O'Neill<br><em>Henry Holt and Co.

The handwritten poem came to be circulated in Black Panther newspapers under Jackson’s name, assumed to be a vestige of his more than a decade long incarceration. But Jackson never wrote the poem; it was authored by the Palestinian poet Sameeh Al-Qassem and had been included in an anthology of the same title a year before Jackson’s death.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Originally published by Drum &amp; Spear, the publishing arm of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Enemy of the Sun: Poetry of Palestinian Resistance links twelve poets working in a poetics of refusal and of hope. Bearing witness to decades of Zionist occupation, to a diaspora exiled in refugee camps and writers held captive in Israeli jails, the collection offers a means to an end: “as poetry, yes it sings—as bullets on a mission; it calls for change.”</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In each poem is a whole life—joy, love, beauty, rage, sorrow, suffering—and in each life is a record of resistance: the traces of a people who refuse to leave their homeland, who time and again alchemize grief into principled struggle. In the intertwined histories of this book, and in the unyielding political edge of the poems themselves, is a long story of solidarity between oppressed peoples: from Palestine to South Africa to Algeria to Vietnam to the United States.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781510737884' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='FantasticLand: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819u2QRmHsL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781510737884' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>FantasticLand: A Novel</a></strong><br>Mike Bockoven<br><em>Skyhorse Publishing (Nov. 20, 2018)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Halloween is upon us, and Mike Bockoven’s delirious <em>FantasticLand</em>—the insanely popular online culture-skewed take on <em>Lord of the Flies</em> meets <em>Battle Royale</em>—was made for these tribally violent, spooky, Jack O’ Lantern times.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Five weeks after a hurricane ravages the isolated Florida coast theme park FantasticLand, the authorities find a scene of horror: heads on spikes outside of rides and human viscera littering the gift shops.

He said, “I didn’t mean to break him like that. But no one takes a shot at us, right?” The Pirates sort of half cheered and someone yelled, “He’s in misery, sir,” and Brock heard that and said, “We can’t have misery around here, now can we?” Then he walked over and shot Austin at least six times. I lost track after the fourth shot, they all blended together. Austin wasn’t facing me after they shot him, and I didn’t have time to look at his body as the Pirates pulled me up and we started walking. It was obvious we were headed back to the Dead Man’s Cove, where I was pretty sure they were going to kill me or hurt me. I remember hearing some of the girls from our group making that sound when you try not to cry but you can’t help it, that sort of sorrowful sob through hands pressed against the mouth. I said earlier that dealing with line jumpers and family men with tempers was the entirety of my hardship up until this point.  The thing that surprised me was, as they dragged me away toward the Pirate part of the park, I was oddly calm. Detached, I think I would call it. Part of my brain was screaming, “They’re going to kill you, they’re going to torture you,” and that was very much on my mind, but panic wasn’t part of the equation. Maybe that had to do with not being able to fight back if I wanted to.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I must have passed out at some point, because I remember having this really vivid dream about water. I don’t remember all of it, but I was in an inner tube floating down this creek like I did in the summers with my grandparents, and things kept reaching up to try to grab me. Hands kept touching my feet whenever they broke the surface of the water, and right before I woke up, I remember one of the hands grabbing onto me. When I woke up from that I was inside the Cannon Splash, which is one of two rides they have in that section of the park. The Cannon, it’s a water ride, but before the big drop, there’s this section where your little pirate ship sails through a village and through a secret pirate cave with jewels and alcoves and jails. It’s pretty easy to recognize because the other ride in the park is set on a pirate ship and doesn’t have nearly the ambience of the Cannon, which is one of the most popular rides in the park. I knew immediately that’s where I was because I was surprisingly lucid when I woke up. I remembered what had happened and where I likely was, and when I saw that I was in a jail cell I was able to put it together fairly quickly. Plus there were three girls in there with me, only one of whom I knew. It was Charlotte, but I could barely tell. She had bruises all over her face and one of her eyes was almost swollen shut. I sat up and when I didn’t feel as sick as before, I asked her what happened to her face. She said, “I won,” and then whistled really loudly and yelled, “<em>He’s awake!</em>” One of the girls had a phone and she took a photo of me, half groggy. I remember it showing up somewhere online after we got out of the park.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A couple of Pirates immediately showed up and unlocked the door. It was a real working cell, which makes no damn sense if you ask me. Why would you create a real cell in a theme park? I’ve heard it was some sort of nod to authenticity or something, but whoever built it was out of their mind. I felt ridiculous being held in a real jail in a fake pirate ride, but before I could dwell on it too much I was dragged out of the cell and down a long hall with water sloshing on my right side. I remember looking at the other cells as they dragged me down the hall, and I saw most of the “prisoners” had been worked over. One had a big black eye, another had a bandage over her cheek and was bruised all over her face. After about thirty-five steps I started to hear a lot of chatter, and then we went into the main room of the ride, which was lit with artificial light. Somehow, this ride had limited power. The light was still soft, but it was the first time I’d seen electric light in a couple of weeks. The main room had a big pool on one side but otherwise was in a bowl shape. Most of the Pirates were about twelve feet above me along the edge of the bowl. The floor was dirty and covered with dust, which was fake, because the floor was concrete, not stone. I remember thinking how stupid it was that this real thing was happening on this fake floor.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Mr. Hockney stepped forward, and everyone immediately quieted. He stared right at me and said, “I have heard you don’t like fighting. Right now you have no choice,” and everyone started yelling. They brought one of the girls from the Fairy Prairie over; I didn’t remember her name then. She looked very scared, but there was a guy and a girl on either side of her, rubbing her shoulders and encouraging her like a trainer would encourage a boxer. Mr. Hockney held up his hand and said, “Membership to the Pirates is something you earn. You get what you want by taking it. The only thing keeping you from our brotherhood is the person in front of you.” Then he just let that hang in the air. I wasn’t even aware he wanted us to fight, but I figured it out when the girl charged me and threw her shoulder into my stomach and knocked the wind out of me completely.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><strong></strong><br><br><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'></div><br><br><br>
