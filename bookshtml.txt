(Is he a robot?) In “Slide to Unlock” a man comes to terms with his life via the passwords he struggles to remember in extremis. (What’s his mom’s name backward?)

Author Jeff Seidel spoke with a wide-ranging selection of former Baltimore players, from such stars as Cal Ripken Jr. and Brooks Robinson to those who had only their fifteen minutes” of fame, such as Dave Criscione and John Stefero. A common thread seems to be how many of the former Orioles stayed in baseball in some form, like Ripken, who started his own minor league team in Aberdeen, Maryland, something that’s clearly close to his heart; or former catcher Andy Etchebarren, a longtime minor league manager and coach.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>Baltimore Orioles: Where Have You Gone?</em>, first published in 2006 and newly updated through the 2016 season, features men like Mike Flanagan, the Cy Young Awardwinning lefty who anchored the Orioles pitching staff in the late ’70s and early ’80s, finally becoming the team’s pitching coach and cogeneral manager. The book also includes a chapter on Tommy Davis, the team’s first designated hitter, who tells how he came up with a key base hit after nearly missing his at-bat because he was talking on the clubhouse telephone; Doug DeCinces, faced with the cruel task of taking over for Brooks Robinson at third base, talking about the huge pressure he faced and how he truly appreciated playing for the Orioles; and finally the legendary Robinson himself, still a fan favorite more than 35 years after retiring, telling how he told the Chicago White Sox thanks, but no thanks, when they asked him about managing. It’s all here; perfect for any Orioles fan!</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9798888457566' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='The War on Science book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gO42HDZAL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9798888457566' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>The War on Science</a></strong><br>Edited by Lawrence M.

As this group of prominent scholars ranging across many different disciplines and political leanings detail, the very future of free inquiry and scientific progress is at risk. Many who have spoken up against this threat have lost their positions, and a climate of fear has arisen that strikes at the heart of modern education and research. Banding together to finally speak out, this brave and unprecedented group of scholars issues a clarion call for change.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Topics include: Free speech, victimhood, ideology, corruption of academic disciplines, cancel culture, DEI, gender, and race, and what we can do. </p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593657508' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='The Art of Exile (Academy of Muses) book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BL2Et0e3L._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593657508' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>The Art of Exile (Academy of Muses)</a></strong><br>Andrea Max<br><em>Margaret K.

But now she finally has the chance to prove her worth: she just needs to gain access to a hidden school that her family has been trying to locate for generations. Granted, she accidentally goes on a date with the recruiter first, then is temporarily abducted, but Ada manages to secure herself an invitation to the Genesis Institute, where descendants of exiled Renaissance masters practice long-lost arts and sciences.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The school is a utopia of sustainable technology, medical advancements, and myths come to life, yet they are unjustly hoarding their resources. Ada goes undercover to steal their innovations for the rest of the world, but Genesis nurtures her creativity and challenges her views, and she can’t help but fall for the school…and maybe also for her frustratingly off-limits recruiter-turned-mentor.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Ada’s tangle of lies starts to unravel when one of her new friends goes missing. To rescue her, Ada is forced to work with a dangerous (and dangerously hot) classmate whose suspicions threaten her cover. And when the information she’s shared with her family puts her missing friend and all of Genesis in peril, she’ll have to choose whom to betray: the family she loves or the school that has helped her find herself.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648210747' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Let Me Try Again book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gzx8ifGbL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648210747' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Let Me Try Again</a></strong><br>Matthew Davis<br><em>Arcade (August 13, 2024)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Ross, a twenty-three-year-old living in New York City, thinks he has it all figured out. He breaks up with his girlfriend only so that she realizes how terrible other men are and how great she really has it with him. But this scheme backfires, horribly, and, to top it off, Ross’s parents die tragically in a helicopter crash, leaving him to take care of his high school-age sister—along with their millions of dollars. As the novel unfolds, it becomes clear that Ross isn’t as clever as he thinks he is.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>But Matthew Davis <em>is </em>clever. He’s ferociously funny, idiosyncratic, and recklessly fearless, in worlds—both the non-reading and the hyper-literary—that have lost their sense of humor along with their guts. There’s nothing try-hardy about <em>Try Harder</em>, only the ease of a young but preternaturally O.G. tummler whose thoughts and monologues are calibrated to both Bellow and Borscht Belt. Unlike Joshua Cohen’s <em>The Netanyahus, </em>it has a light touch;<em> </em>if anyone had a sense of humor, <em>Let Me Try Again </em>could have won the Jewish National Book Award. </p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Oh, well.

Mom, on more than one occasion, warned me never <em>ever </em>to be in the same room with a Ouija board . . .</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Dad had rituals of his own that revealed superstitious impulses. Having special shirts and underwear he’d wear to work when he was “slumping,” which is to say, not selling a sufficient number of motor vehicles. He’d also repeatedly made clear to me: “Don’t talk bad about people. Whatever you say about others will happen to you. Life has a way of catching up with you.” Which, I don’t really see why this would be true, but in my biased (so often fooled by randomness!) mind, it seems to happen quite often.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>And this, more so than my mom’s warning against Ouijas, bounced around in my mind in the moments after Madison (the woman I met on the unprotected sex app) crudely stormed out of my apartment and called me “a truly, deeply pathetic guy” and a “coward the likes of which the world has never seen,” and said that I would “pay” for what I “did to her.” Despite my best efforts to seem unfazed by and unconcerned with the opinions of others (to an arguably pathological level), for the past few days I’ve found myself fixating on my near-sex-experience, and its resolution. How harsh the sound of her slamming my door was—it seemed she really put the full strength of her large left arm into pulling it shut, a final tantrum meant to torture me after I broke the news (“We absolutely will not be having sex, unprotected or otherwise. Now, I kindly ask you to leave”) to her and sent her out into a car I’d ordered for her on an app on my phone.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>And as an immediate consequence of her slamming shut my front door (due to my refusal to give her <em>every piece</em> of me . . .), my glass-encased <em>mezuzah </em>lost its connection to the upper right corner of my doorframe and fell to the floor, fracturing into three large pieces. “Well that’s inauspicious,” I said aloud in the voice I often use when there’s no one around to hear me. “I don’t even know what a mezuzah’s for!” I exclaimed exasperatedly, again, to no one but myself.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>But I knew I didn’t like the idea of mine falling on the floor and breaking, especially because this had been given to me by my Bubbe, who told me to bring it with me to New York City, and touch it sometimes when I walked through the door, and then kiss my fingers after I touched it. And I actually <em>did </em>do this. Probably two or three times a week before that woman slammed my door shut and caused it to fall to the floor and break. But still, in the immediate aftermath of its breaking, I thought very little of it, instead focusing on trying to replay this negative interaction I’d just had with M (Madison).</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>For eighty-eight hours straight, I holed up in my apartment, lying around in bed, barely moving, only taking one shower a day, subsisting on nothing but low-carb protein bars and this new dissolvable “Greens” powder that claimed to contain a day’s servings of vegetables (and fruits) in every scoop. I simply wasn’t myself—my usual cool and unaffected self. During this seclusion, I accomplished absolutely nothing of productive value. . .</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>. . . At 12 p.m., after three days inside, I came out of hiding, convinced of this perspective: that it was wrong to be Ross. I ran down the stairs of my building in a frenzy, in a truly manic mood, ready to do something drastic. I got out onto the cloudy autumn streets of Roosevelt Island and marched intently toward the Bread N Butter Market, one of a small handful of convenience stores located on the island. I walked up to the counter and the man began shaking his head at me: “No bathroom! No bathroom!” he kept saying.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“No bathroom! No bathroom!” I replied in agreement, raising my arms and straightening my fingers as if to signal, <em>don’t shoot!</em></p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Here to buy cigarette,” I added, leaving off the letter ‘s’ in <em>cigarettes</em> because I thought it would help him understand me better.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“You? Cigarette?” he asked, nearly erupting with incredulous laughter.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Yes, <em>me</em>, cigarette. Marlboro <em>Lights</em>, in fact! One pack, please,” I added, even though I didn’t really understand what a “light” cigarette was or could be.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The man behind the counter handed me this golden pack of smokes, and I tapped my Watch against a point of sale (POS) terminal until it buzzed slightly, giving me a haptic indication that my credit card had been charged for this pack of cigarettes. On the box, I read the words “LOW TAR &amp; NICOTINE,” which sounded reasonable enough to me. . .</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I peeled back the lid on the cigs, took one out, and held it in my hand, already feeling cool, fiddling and fidgeting with it. It was going to be perfect. I put it back into the pack and the pack into my jacket pocket and waved hello to my doorman and walked into the elevator up to my apartment.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Calmer, now that I’d made my purchase and conceived of an escape hatch from my citadel of suffocating sobriety, I sat down on my green loveseat and again picked up the pack of smokes, pulling them out of my pocket and up to eye level. “Your golden ticket, Ross,” I said to myself. “Why not have one right now? Smoke indoors, that way your whole apartment stinks of smoke and people think you’re a laid-back <em>Bohemian</em>?” The idea wasn’t half bad. I could smoke inside my apartment, hotbox the place, and then people (women) would come over and fancy me a carefree artistic type, living a relaxed island lifestyle of cigarette smoking and casual (yet passionate) romance.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I plucked a single fag out of the box and with two fingers, held it up to my lips, miming my eventual first inhalation while watching an online video titled “HOW TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE (FULL TUTORIAL)” with over nine hundred thousand views. Empowering. I could really feel it: the entire world at my fingertips. But at about two minutes into the six-minute video, as I attempted to follow along, I realized I had neglected to purchase any lighters or matches from the man at the Bread N Butter Market. Typical, idiotic, forgetful Ross. You could have all the light cigarettes in the world, but without a lighter, they were useless! Perhaps I had a lighter, left behind from Lora or for candles or something. Or some matches taken from the maître d’ desk at a fancy restaurant. I walked over to my “junk drawer,” silently asking “please let there be something in here . . .” (although I’m not sure to whom) and instead only found a tangled nest of weird wires, several batteries of dubious levels of charge, and the three fractured pieces of my <em>mezuzah </em>which I couldn’t bring myself to throw out after it had shattered several days earlier.</p></div><br><br><br>
