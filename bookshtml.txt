Back then, Katy and Elyce were preoccupied with frat parties and <em>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</em>; within a decade, they’d be scraping by in New York City, working day jobs to spend nights building a new line of handbags that would one day revolutionize the accessories industry.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>We Might Just Make It After All </em>brings us on the rollercoaster of adventures (and misadventures) that the best friends embarked on, from transferring colleges on a whim, to falling in and out of love with suitors, cramming into roach-infested Hell’s Kitchen apartments, and eventually designing the chic, simple bag that would launch the pair to global fame. Through it all, Katy and Elyce’s friendship remained unshakeable. This powerful friendship lasted nearly forty years, until Katy’s tragic suicide in 2018. <em>We Might Just Make It After All</em> celebrates her legacy as a cultural icon and loyal friend.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Set against the glitzy and gritty backdrop of downtown New York at the turn of the century, <em>We Might Just Make It After All </em>lovingly and candidly explores the power of a friendship as close as sisterhood, the challenges facing women entrepreneurs in the 1990s, and the timeless elegance of a generation-defining brand.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211409' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Some Recollections of St. Ives: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81hnxqVpr3L._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211409' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Some Recollections of St. Ives: A Novel</a></strong><br>David Mamet<br><em>Arcade (August 5, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>David Mamet, the iconic, legendary, prolific film director, screenwriter, and playwright, brings us his latest work, <em>Some Recollections of St. Ives</em>, a novel-cum-memoir of Charles Hollis—a fictional educator at the fictional institution of the St. Ives School.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Mamet revels in creating a magisterial, incisive portrait of an isolated world—St. Ives—and its place in the wider culture via his segmented yet commingling history of this place and the people who haunted it during Charles Hollis’s, the fictional narrator’s, heyday. Slightly unexpected, this novel is extraordinary and a welcome addition to the Mamet canon.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Toward the end, Hollis reflects, “Most of that passing as literature must be classed with the love letters. The recipient, if moved at all, is likely moved by the display in the writer of perseverance against impossible odds; the noble struggle here that to force compliance, not from the obdurate heart, but from the uncaring English Language.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>But Mamet cares—and for that, the English language and the world are enriched. In the end, <em>Some Recollections of St. Ives </em>is a love letter, as is all of Mamet’s work.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211410' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Some Recollections of St. Ives: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81hnxqVpr3L._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211410' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Some Recollections of St. Ives: A Novel</a></strong><br>David Mamet<br><em>Arcade (August 6, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>David Mamet </strong>is America's foremost playwright.

To do so we will read it in the mirror.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He would then ask a boy, to pick, at random, “any article, any article at all.” A report of political rancor would ignite a discussion of Bismark, Tsar Peter, Elizabeth, or Caesar, “playing dominoes with the world.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>That of a grisly murder, Hamlet, Othello, Jael and Sisera, Pinchas, or the Code of Hammurabi.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A bold lad would suggest the sports page, prompting a discussion of David and Goliath, or the ritual sacrifices of the Mayans. Or he would quote from Tacitus on Sport, or the Norman Trial by Ordeal—“those chronicles of single combat, what do you think they were but the Sporting News? And now, read in the mirror, what is the Sporting News but the record of our chosen Knights, their victory proving the personal superiority of their adherents—we that are hus proved the elect of God?”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Inevitably, some lad would read an advertisement, and Fossett would smile and counsel, “never admit you doubt as irrational the Divinity of Christ, or that Mohammed Ascended, upon his horse, into Heaven, you who accept, unthinkingly, that an abrasive sweetened clay, rubbed on your teeth, will find you a mate. Whereby we might perceive a connection between our so-called ‘modern thought,’ and similar magical thinking in the Past, the extirpation of Witches; and various and ineradicable operations of the Pagan mind, still operating in a toothpaste ad.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“We, speaking as a Christian, may believe or disbelieve in the Divinity of Christ, but it is a thoughtless error to dismiss it as ‘unreasonable.’</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“May we rid ourselves of folly? The study of history establishes that we may not. Education exists not to inculcate wisdom, but, much more attractively, to teach the identification of folly. Let us consider it as strategy. Many of you play team sports. Do you not find it helpful, in your football game, to have studied the other side’s strategy? Respond ‘Yes, Sir.’</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Here we do the same. Our team is Character, let us call our opponents Human Nature.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“We can but with difficultly perceive their tactics on the field, for we are there engaged in all-out struggle.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“But they have, thoughtfully, left their playbook lying around, and we may study it at leisure. It is called the Newspaper.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>And here he would assign to each an article, editorial, or advertisement.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“These are the same events, prejudices, and blandishments which have troubled man from the beginning. They have been treated by the great writers of old. Your task is to find whence these plagiarists of today have stolen their material, and explain to our team their crime.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He would then raise the shade covering the blackboard and reveal his “beloved list of fifteen books.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Human history is the record of sex, violence, sin, treason, perversion and madness. Here” (pointing to the board), “you may find helpful guides to your investigations.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“I am sorry to expose you to the shocking, the salacious, the outlandish, and the cruel. And bid you be strong in your dedication. Spare yourselves and spare us nothing. Tell us about the World.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Fossett was asked, in his last days, how many boys, did he feel, had profited from his unorthodox approach.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“From the study of History, perhaps some,” he said, “perhaps some. From my heterodoxy, I do believe, some greater number.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Our tradition of heterodoxy, of course, dates back to him, and his teaching of Greek.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>His method, so successful here, was attempted and abandoned by the Seven Brothers of the New England Convention.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Fossett had always opposed our membership in “The Communion,” as he termed it, proclaiming that he saw no reason to expand a “Council of Mediocrity,” past that number he could comfortably refute over one glass of bad sherry.</p>p>He held, in hisdefense,andnot unreasonably, that his methods worked, and if their demonstrable success was insufficient to convince the merely theoretical, the inquisitive were welcome to come to his class and watch.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>On his retirement the School did, in fact, join the Convention; and prior to his removal (to his brother’s house, at Leamington), their Board of Governors asked him to attend the Spring Meeting, where they would announce a Special Award, to be bestowed every two years, for extraordinary achievements in education—such to be called The Jellicoe Plaque.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The invitation was replied to by his attorney, who declined “what you perhaps call an honor,” adding that any use whatever of his client’s name would result in legal action.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>From his diary for 9 April 1921, “who would delight in the endorsement of a congeries of fools in Boston?”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He lived to see his methods, long disputed, misunderstood, and traduced, in his final years, endorsed by various panels of educators; much to his disgust—he who famously held that one or two of his boys had “perhaps learned something from a teacher, but who on earth had learned anything from an Educator?”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>His opinions on the instruction of languages were learned, as he said, in “The Best Possible School.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A resident of Tokyo (1892–1895), he learned Japanese and worked as a civilian employee of their Imperial Army as a translator (from the French) of various Military theses. At the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War, 1894, he was offered employment by the Japanese Army, with an equivalent rank of Lieutenant. This they considered a great and signal honor. He declined.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Having accepted employment by the Army he was, he was informed, under law, subject to conscription. He refused to serve, and spent the years 1894–1895 as a convict, “denied the Honor of a Military Prison,” confined in a Prisoner of War Camp outside Kyoto.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In the Camp, “in order to survive, and, more importantly, to hear the stories,” he learned several dialects of Chinese, “and enough Korean to order a sandwich.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>His quip, “If a three-year-old child can learn German, why cannot I do the same?” was, later made famous (in, he graciously held, “a coincidental spontaneously created insight”), by a famous language school. Fossett denied any credit, holding that the observation was obvious.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>So in the two years of his war, he became fluent not only in the two Asian languages as above, but in the Russian of his fellow prisoners; and was honored by his fellow prisoners for teaching them the languages of the other inmates.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He brought his perceptions to us, and it was indeed a fortunate day when he presented himself here in January 1919.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He showed the head, Jellicoe, the clipping from the Northeast Educator, and announced himself ready to fill that advertised spot (Teacher of Languages). Asked for his vitae he had none. University degrees, he had none. Jellicoe said, “Why should I hire you to teach languages?” And Fossett said, “Because I can.”</p></div><br><br><br>
