Taking aim at the ideology of critical race theory, the rise of an oppressive social media, the fall from Obama to Trump, and the twinned crises of COVID-19 and the murder of George Floyd, Williams documents the extent to which this transition has altered media, artistic creativity, education, employment, policing, and, most profoundly, the ambient language and culture we use to make sense of our lives.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Williams also decries how liberalism—the very foundation of an open and vibrant society—is in existential crisis, under assault from both the right and the left, especially in our predominantly networked, Internet-driven monoculture.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Sure to be highly controversial, <em>Summer of Our Discontent</em> is a compelling

His classic <em>The Gift of Fear </em>became a worldwide bestseller, illuminating intuition as a powerful warning tool against potential danger and violence. Passionate readers of his work – mothers and daughters (and Oprah Winfrey), along with the Department of Justice, the Secret Service, the CIA, and countless police departments around the nation – routinely turn to his insights and counsel. His work is notable for leaving emotions, dogma, and politics at the door.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>Forbidden Facts: Government Deceit & Suppression About Brain Damage From Childhood Vaccines </em>is de Becker at his very best. At the beginning of Covid, instincts told him something wasn’t right. Years of investigative work followed that intuitive moment, inevitably leading to the irrefutable conclusion that Government agencies and Big Pharma routinely conspire to deceive the public on matters of profound importance. This story of true crime includes bogus research, bribes, gaslit “debunking,” compromised experts, paid conspirators, destruction of evidence, and massive publicity campaigns to discredit people and truths that don’t fit official wishes.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In a world where heroes have become public enemies, de Becker is a truth warrior on a Hero’s Journey.

A New York Times bestselling author, his books include The Gift of Fear, now published in twenty-eight languages. His 600-person consulting firm has advised many government agencies.<br /> <br /> “How do you refute officious government-promoted medical falsehoods and gaslighting? This book leads by example. With sardonic wit, de Becker carefully, calmly, and objectively documents how government, industry, and academia have colluded to create false narratives that seem definitive. Most of all, he invites readers to draw their own conclusions.” <br /> <strong>—Robert Malone, MD, MS, physician, virologist, molecular biologist, and co-chair of CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices</strong></p><h5 style="padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 16px;">An Excerpt from <em>Forbidden Facts</em></h5><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The Earth is round, not flat, as everyone knows. And it rotates around the sun. Can we all agree on those two? Can we also agree that gravity is the force that pulls objects toward the center of the planet?</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Though there was a time these beliefs were hotly debated, they are today considered facts. Another thing everybody knows is that there is no link between childhood vaccines and autism. Everybody knows that notion has been debunked. Despite everybody being quite certain vaccines don’t contribute to autism, since that possibility has been debunked, just about nobody can answer these two simple questions.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>Who debunked it?</strong></p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>How was it debunked?</strong></p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Most people can’t answer even one of those questions, and that includes most pediatricians. Perhaps it was debunked so completely and obviously (known as being ‘thoroughly debunked’) that there’s no need to ever wonder how or why we are all so sure. It would be like questioning gravity, except that the theory of gravity can be tested by any of us all day long. The idea that the vaccine-autism link has been debunked is more like an article of faith, akin to Adam and Eve being the first two people on Earth.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>But this is not religion; this is science, right? And that raises a third question:</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>What is autism?</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Surely there must be wide agreement on what exactly autism is.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>But there isn’t. There are no consistent biomarkers, no consistent physical characteristics, no blood or urine tests to confirm diagnoses—because autism is not a distinct disease. It’s called a disorder, and was previously called a syndrome—a collection of observed symptoms subject to interpretation.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Though government scientists can’t hold firm to a definition of autism and don’t know what causes it, they claim with fist-clenching certainty to know what does <em><u>not </u></em>cause autism. How are they so sure? Because, as we’re all aware, any link between vaccines and autism has been debunked. Since you probably don’t know a single person who can say how it was debunked, or by whom, let’s get that foundational question out of the way now.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The possibility that any child’s autism could be linked to any vaccine or combination of vaccines was debunked by the Institute of Medicine (IOM).</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>What’s the Institute of Medicine? Many people assume it’s a prestigious government entity, but it’s actually a totally private organization, often paid by government, and sometimes paid by private industry, including Pharma.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>As you read on, it’ll be your call to decide how much trust to invest in IOM.  Similarly, you’ll decide how much trust to invest in me. On the one hand, I’m not a doctor, and on the other hand I’m not opining on medical science. I am a criminologist sharing information about corruption, crime and deceit, and I am a behavioral scientist sharing a few insights about human behavior and human nature. And I am a parent. I have followed my curiosity and skepticism, exactly as you can. In any event, the reader is not asked to trust me on anything, since citations with links to source material are provided throughout these pages.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Before we look at how and why IOM debunked the vaccine-autism link, let’s take a quick look at another claim they debunked, the claim that the biological weapon Agent Orange caused sickness in some Vietnam Veterans, and birth defects in some of their children.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Agent Orange might seem irrelevant to the vaccine-autism issue, however IOM used some of the very same people and applied the very same process to reach the same conclusion for both Agent Orange and vaccines. And in both instances, their debunking conclusions were extensively marketed to the American public in the same way.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A quick bit of history:</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>For almost ten years, the US military sprayed Agent Orange onto jungles and people in Vietnam. An ingredient known as TCDD is the most toxic form of dioxin, and causes severe injury, including malformations in test animals, and (no surprise) in people too.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>After studies showed that Agent Orange caused birth defects in test animals, the Department of Defense promised to reduce its use, though it would take years before it was officially suspended. Even the official suspension didn’t end it, because some military units falsified reports to conceal their continued use of Agent Orange. Eventually the military really did stop using it in Vietnam because, well, the war in Vietnam ended. By that point, many returning veterans had reported debilitating health problems in themselves and their children, affirmed by ever-expanding and terrible toxicologic reports about TCDD.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>To resist and reject these claims, the US Government wrote a check to IOM. Whether debunking the crazy idea that injecting mercury into children could possibly cause any neurological injury, or debunking the crazy idea that a military weapon containing dioxin could possibly be linked to health issues, IOM sang the same dreadful dirge. For example, they used the same approach in both scientific inquiries. (‘Scientific inquiry’ is a phrase that stretches those two words to the breaking point) . . .</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In 2011, the Institute of Medicine was hired to debunk another reality the Government didn’t like: serious health consequences from exposure to burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>With a wave of their diplomas and an authoritative pronouncement, the IOM committee debunked the idea that breathing smoke from burn pits caused cancer or respiratory disease, or any disease at all. Heck, breathing that smoke might even have been healthy.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>What other health concerns has the IOM been hired to debunk?</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>Cancer from Baby Powder, Gulf War Syndrome, Dangers of Silicone Implants, Gulf War Illness, Anthrax Vaccine, SIDS – all debunked.</em></p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Some old timey vaccine ingredients were made by steeping them for years in a mix of ox bile, glycerin, and potato slices. (Yes, really.) Over time, vaccinations evolved to include:</p><ul style='margin-bottom:16px;'><li>dried rabbit spinal cords</li><li>duck embryos</li><li>chicken blood</li><li>human bile</li><li>ground-up rat spleens</li><li>boiled pig skin</li></ul><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>But enough about the past — we’ve come a long way since then. Here are some ingredients in today’s modern vaccines:</p><ul style='margin-bottom:16px;'><li>Gelatin from boiled pig skin</li><li>Chicken embryo protein</li><li>Blood from the hearts of cow fetuses</li><li>Human fetus DNA fragments</li><li>Albumin from human blood plasma</li><li>Oil extracted from shark livers</li><li>Proteins from armyworm ovaries</li><li>Monkey kidney DNA fragments</li></ul><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>There’s a famous scene in Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth </em>that depicts three witches stirring a bubbling cauldron, chanting out the ingredients of their brew:</p><ul style='margin-bottom:16px;'><li>eye of newt</li><li>toe of frog</li><li>lizard’s leg</li><li>tongue of dog</li></ul><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I don’t know why that play came to mind, but let’s get back to vaccine ingredients...</p></div><br><br><br>
