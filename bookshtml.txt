Hicks McTaggart, a onetime strikebreaker turned private eye, thinks he’s found job security until he gets sent out on what should be a routine case, locating and bringing back the heiress of a Wisconsin cheese fortune who’s taken a mind to go wandering. Before he knows it, he’s been shanghaied onto a transoceanic liner, ending up eventually in Hungary where there’s no shoreline, a language from some other planet, and enough pastry to see any cop well into retirement—and of course no sign of the runaway heiress he’s supposed to be chasing. By the time Hicks catches up with her he will find himself also entangled with Nazis, Soviet agents, British counterspies, swing musicians, practitioners of the paranormal, outlaw motorcyclists, and the troubles that come with each of them, none of which Hicks is qualified, forget about being paid, to deal with. Surrounded by history he has no grasp on and can’t see his way around in or out of, the only bright side for Hicks is it’s the dawn of the Big Band Era and as it happens he’s a pretty good dancer. Whether this will be enough to allow him somehow to Lindy-hop his way back again to Milwaukee and the normal world, which may no longer exist, is another question.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781324094647' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='The Gales of November: The Untold Story of the Edmund Fitzgerald book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81kfMGiLweL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781324094647' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>The Gales of November: The Untold Story of the Edmund Fitzgerald</a></strong><br>John U.

Bacon explores the vital role Great Lakes shipping played in America’s economic boom, the uncommon lives the sailors led, the sinking’s most likely causes, and the heartbreaking aftermath for those left behind―"the wives, the sons, and the daughters,” as Gordon Lightfoot sang in his unforgettable ballad.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Focused on those directly affected by the tragedy, <em>The Gales of November</em> is both an emotional tribute to the lives lost and a propulsive, page-turning narrative history of America’s most-mourned maritime disaster.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781510785588' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Exposed: A Pfizer Scientist Battles Corruption, Lies, and Betrayal, and Becomes a Biohazard Whistleblower book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CfvRvI+0L._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781510785588' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Exposed: A Pfizer Scientist Battles Corruption, Lies, and Betrayal, and Becomes a Biohazard Whistleblower</a></strong><br>Becky McClain<br><em>Skyhorse (October 28, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>A powerful memoir of a molecular biologist’s courageous fight against corporate retaliation after revealing dangerous biosafety failures in biotech labs.</strong><br /> <br /> When molecular biologist Becky McClain raised urgent alarms about biosafety lapses at her biotech lab at Pfizer, she expected concern—not retaliation. Instead, her warnings about dangerous, genetically engineered viruses that were handled without following standard safety protocols were met with hostility, intimidation, and ultimately, devastating illness after a workplace exposure changed her life forever.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>Exposed</em> is McClain’s riveting memoir of her transformation from dedicated scientist to the nation’s first successful biotech whistleblower. Chronicling her battle against a powerful industry and its culture of secrecy, McClain reveals the high personal cost of speaking out, the legal showdown that rocked Pfizer, and the alarming gaps in biosafety and regulatory oversight that put workers—and the public—at risk.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781250341716' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Cinder House book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81zNft8fpAL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781250341716' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Cinder House</a></strong><br>Freya Marske<br><em>Tordotcom (October 7, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>Sparks fly and lovers dance in this gorgeous, yearning Cinderella retelling from bestselling author Freya Marske</strong><strong>―a queer Gothic romance perfect for fans of Naomi Novik and T.

Him and his shipmates form bonds by joking and telling stories to kill time as they travel through international waters. When a shipmate is suspected of being a Chinese spy, ensuing paranoia shatters the camaraderie onboard. And when a death of another shipmate leaves Dead Man guilt-ridden and traumatized, he decides to leave the Navy for greener pastures. By the time Dead Man leaves the boat, he’s newly adrift in the era of COVID, George Floyd riots, and pronoun-obsessed peers. His jokes don’t land like they used to; only the ghosts of former sea cronies, dead and alive, are still laughing. In <em>Things That Are Funny on a Submarine But Not Really</em> what emerges is a ghost story about the living. A dark, tender torpedo of a novel. Sometimes things <em>are </em>funny on a submarine, because Murphy makes it so—and poignant and mind-blowing too. Yes. Really.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211355' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Things That Are Funny on a Submarine But Not Really: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cVu07+S+L._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211355' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Things That Are Funny on a Submarine But Not Really: A Novel</a></strong><br>Yannick Murphy<br><em>Arcade (November 4, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>Yannick Murphy</strong> is the author of the novels <em>This Is the Water</em>, <em>The Call</em>, <em>Signed, Mata Hari</em>, <em>Here They Come</em>, and<em> The Sea of Trees</em>.

While having to clean the radio room, I play loud rap music and we all dance around, feeling great because finally we can breathe. Then I play <em>Rodeo—Four Dances</em> by Aaron Copland, which is what my dad always liked to play when I was growing up. Tintin, whose real name is Kowalski, likes it too and tells everyone to shut it and listen, and so they do. Tintin has a cowlick just like the cartoon character Tintin. It always sticks up, even when he hasn’t showered for weeks, and his hair is heavy with grease. I’ve known Tintin since sub school. On the first day in class, I answered some sub question right about what’s a Crazy Ivan. I knew from watching all the submarine movies with my father that a Crazy Ivan is a series of sharp turns the sub makes to evade a hostile. Tintin told everyone I was the smartest guy in the school, and because Tintin is Tintin, everyone believed him. I tried to tell him I didn’t know anything, and that in high school all I did was sit in the student lounge and play video games, but it didn’t matter. Word spread fast. Tintin had ordained me the smartest out of all of us.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Guys paid me in cigarettes to show them my answers on the tests we took in class. Even now, on the boat, guys just throw trivia questions at me for fun. “Hey, Sterling,” Baitz says while wiping the computer screens with a cloth, “who was Alotta Fagina in <em>Austin Powers</em>?” That’s easy. We’ve watched <em>Austin Powers</em> during movie night on our last underway at least four times.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“The Italian secretary,” I say. But if they asked me what the capital of Italy was, I couldn’t be sure. It’s the useless stuff I know, but hey, it’s the useless stuff we can’t get enough of.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Now, more often than before, when guys are bored, they want me to tell them stories. Stories I’ve told before about me and my family. About the time my father nearly cut his finger off in the wood-splitter, about the time when we went on a family snorkeling vacation in Panama in a boat, and we were stranded because our motor hit a whale’s back, then my father started passing a kidney stone at the same time. The guys on the boat want to hear the story about the time the heavy snow on the powerline cut the electricity, so my father went out with the shotgun and tried to shoot the snow off. They want to hear about the calls I went on with my father, the veterinarian, to treat horses and cattle. The time we pulled out a newborn calf, but it was dead, and all we pulled out were the legs that had broken off from the rest of the body that was still inside the mother. The time a horse fell into its water trough and got stuck, and we used a rope and the truck to help pull it out. When I tell the stories, the guys on the boat laugh at all the same parts they laughed at before, and they want to hear more, and if I forget to tell one part of the story, they remind me and make me add it back in.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Suddenly, we hear the general alarm go off. It’s a fire drill. We stop cleaning and run to our positions. I’m a rapid responder manning a hose and putting out a fire simulated by a string of red LED lights sticking out from the bottom of the clothes dryer. After a while, I’m relieved by Tintin, who’s wearing an SCBA, so I run back aft to escape from the heavy simulated smoke when I see another fire in crew’s mess, so I route another shit-ass hose to that fire and start fighting it, but then when I’m relieved from that fire, I’m told I died. <em>But</em> the COB compliments me for saving the ship. So now everyone starts calling me Dead Man, and for so long I haven’t had a nickname, and then I get stuck with Dead Man, which, if you try to tell people is not your nickname, they just call you it more. Not even Tintin can keep everyone from calling me Dead Man, even though he went around telling people he’d cut off their tongues with the saw blade on his Leatherman if they didn’t shut up. I don’t say jack and hope that Dead Man fades away.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Days later, when we’re off Hawaii, the COB lets me stand on the sail, and in the wind, the old US of A flag keeps clanking on the shaft of the periscope sounding like someone trapped beneath the hatch and banging a hammer on the steel to get out. The COB points out the seamount range with mountains named after classical composers not far away. I think how there should really be an Aaron Copland mount. Why did Liszt get the highest mount, at 5,190 feet? Then I wonder sometimes if we’re sailing over wrecks of those Japanese destroyers and cruisers from the great naval battles of WWII. Even though back then we had radar range finding for their guns, the Japanese still tried, in the bitter end, to beat us with the skill of their sailors. The COB says don’t tell me you think the Japanese should have won the war. I tell him I wouldn’t have minded growing up eating sushi and sake.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“It’s always about your goddamn stomach with you, isn’t it, Dead Man,” he says, and he pokes me hard in my gut.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Isn’t it better than being racist?” I ask him. Then he says, get down below, you’re blocking my view. I’m lucky he doesn’t lay into me more. All it takes is one situation like this with a higher-up for me to end up with my ass in a sling and me sitting at captain’s mast trying to talk my way out of a dishonorable discharge.</p></div><br><br><br>
