The historic legal effort is inseparable from the surreal context and the absurdities of hosting the biggest case in US history in what is effectively a small Caribbean beach town. <em>America’s Trial </em>serves as a necessary bookend to events that have defined much of the war on terror.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593498798' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='For Richer For Poorer: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BvH+3HlOL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593498798' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>For Richer For Poorer: A Novel</a></strong><br>Danielle Steel<br><em>Delacorte Press (August 12, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>A loving mother and successful fashion designer struggles to keep her family together and her business afloat in this gripping novel by #1 <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author Danielle Steel.</strong><br /> <br /> After working as head designer for Oscar de la Renta, Eugenia Ward started her own company when she turned forty, fourteen years ago.

Perhaps you were overwhelmed with the weight of worry, the fear of failing, or the grip of guilt. The way we think directly impacts our joy and peace. In <em>Tame Your Thoughts</em>, Max Lucado provides three biblical and practical tools to renew your mind and transform your life.</strong><br /> <br /> Our thoughts have consequences. Most people would agree that positive thoughts generate positive actions. Negative thoughts activate negative behavior. But do we understand that we can manage our lives by managing our thoughts? Not only does neuroscience back this concept, but the idea is also embedded throughout Scripture. "Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind" (Rom.12:2 esv). Tame your thoughts and transform your life!</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In <em>Tame Your Thoughts</em>, Max explores three key thought-management tools and then applies them to the most common thought problems: worry, guilt, anxiety, and other types of mental quicksand that threaten to trap us. God loves us too much to let us lead a life marked by poor thinking. He made our brains; he can retrain our brains. God has not left us alone in this battle of the mind.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781958888698' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='All These Ghosts book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pOI0xbtkL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781958888698' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>All These Ghosts</a></strong><br>Silas House<br><em>Blair (September 9, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>A timely and poignant poetry collection by acclaimed author and former Poet Laureate of Kentucky Silas House, including the poem read at Governor Andy Beshear’s 2023 inauguration and an interview by Barbara Kingsolver.</strong><br /> <br /> Silas House is known throughout the South as a quintessential person of letters—a novelist, music journalist, environmental activist, columnist, and the former Poet Laureate of Kentucky. His first full-length collection of poetry blends his Appalachian upbringing with his ongoing relation to the natural world. Poems of praise for community and the collective appear alongside others tinged with nostalgia and grief when House keenly observes the loss of rural America as he once knew it. Returning to his touchstone subjects, Silas recalls wild places, echoes stories from a lingering and living past, and explores an abiding connection to family, friends, and fellow artists.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781956763669' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='To the Kennels: And Other Stories book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81hgUoS8hsL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781956763669' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>To the Kennels: And Other Stories</a></strong><br>By Hye-young Pyun

(In South Korea, she’s a superstar!) This highly acclaimed story collection unleashes a gallery of grotesques—a fog-shrouded highway becomes a corridor to private hells; the dream of country-living curdles under the din of incessant barking from the nearby dog kennels; a couple’s home, overrun with pests, undergoes their nocturnal renovations with disastrous and deadly results. Those are only a few of the strange and unsettling tales within.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The landscapes in <em>To the Kennels</em> aren’t backdrops—they’re psychological trapdoors, yawning beneath genteel veneers. Her prose slithers with Kafkaesque dread, rendering the familiar uncanny, cutting a margin between your expectations and the disturbing truth.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Pyun stages this collection, not on the page, but in your skull with an audience of your own anxieties. These stories make you feel things you’ve never felt before, and they’ll corner you in well-appointed rooms while they gleefully dismantle the furniture and any sense of security you thought you had. But in a good way.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781956763669' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='To the Kennels: And Other Stories book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81hgUoS8hsL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781956763669' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>To the Kennels: And Other Stories</a></strong><br>By Hye-young Pyun

The hogweed, its roots firmly planted in the red mud, peeked over the wall. The plants had to be well over seven feet tall. An invasive species that had made itself at home there, its stalks were as thick and strong as bamboo. The roar of passing trucks hung in the air; the trucks could have been equally close or far. The house shook ever so slightly. His wife’s gaze followed the lights of the trucks as she asked loudly, “This L person, can you trust him?”</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>L was the one who had told him about the manager at the brick factory and his under-the-table dealings. Annoyed at the volume of his wife’s voice, he stomped purposefully out to the garden. The rodents that had been scurrying beneath the veranda held their breath as if alarmed by the sudden stomping. He went to the center of the garden and noisily worked the manual water pump. The rusty pump gave off a sour, metallic smell. He shoved down on the handle as hard as he could; water poured into the metal basin. The water was freezing. D City had been so hot that afternoon that simply standing outside felt like a struggle, but once the sun went down everything had turned frigid instead.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“He’s a U City person now,” he said. “I can’t trust anyone in <em>this </em>town.”</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>His wife lowered her voice, as if reminded by the noisy pump.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“That’s the problem. L moved to U City from here. Can you really trust him? I heard he was able to leave this place and move there because he got reward money. Everyone’s saying he sold someone out.”</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He leaned as close to his wife as possible and said, “We have no choice. Who else but him could get us what we need?”</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>All he owned was a shovel with a dull blade and an old pickaxe with a loose handle. Everything else he needed for construction he had to buy or borrow—from the bricks, cement, sand, and gravel to a drill that didn’t make too much noise. His wife shrugged and walked slowly back to the kitchen. Her shadow filled the kitchen window. After her parents died, she’d put on nearly a hundred pounds. The sudden weight gain had ruined her joints and her digestion. Her arms and legs hurt all the time, and she suffered from arthritis and muscle aches. She had to eat constantly to satisfy her distended stomach. She reminded him of a soft, pulpy mollusk, a snail with its trail of slime. And in fact she moved as slowly as a snail and left a trail of crumbs and food smears everywhere she went. He watched his ever-expanding wife for a moment, then went inside.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Their child, who’d been staring at the TV, studied the blue bruises in her flesh in lieu of a greeting. The bruises made the child look even filthier than she was. When she was born, he hadn’t been sure at first who the child took after, but now it was obvious. His child took after his wife. He never went anywhere with the child. Their one and only outing together was when he’d gathered up the newborn and brought her from the hospital to this house where his wife’s parents’ corpses lay.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He worked for the government office that managed the twenty-three tombs in the tumuli park. It was a special contract position with the Cultural Heritage Administration. Children who came to the park ruined the grass with all their running around. They would hide behind things and jump out, startling him. They left trash in hard-to-find places and peed wherever they pleased. He hated children.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Back when the tumuli park was built in the 1970s, there’d been plans to put a wall around it. Construction had just begun when another grave, thousands of years old, was uncovered. It was older by hundreds of years than the stone-mound tombs with their wooden burial chambers. They said fifteen more were found where they had planned to build the rest of the wall.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He muttered to himself as he ate his dinner, which had grown cold. He had no idea what was so special about wooden-whatever stone tombs or how ancient they were supposed to be. Everything he knew had come from the information posted next to the ticket office at the park. As for the ages of the grave goods on display that had been excavated from the twenty-three tombs, he’d had to memorize those.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“What if there’s a bunch of ancient stuff buried under our wall, too? Maybe we should hold a memorial service before we knock it down and dig everything up? What if the king was assassinated and is still mad about it? How do you appease an angry ghost?”</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He barely got the last word out before his wife threw her spoon at him. The spoon, smeared with rice, hit his left eye. The child giggled. His wife was convinced the spirits of her dead parents had become hungry ghosts and were clinging to their child. “Shameless ghosts, got nowhere to go so you bother an innocent child. . . .” And yet, despite those words, she never touched or patted the girl. He picked up her spoon from where it had fallen in front of the door. His wife was already eating again, using his spoon. He knew better than to mess with her. At the slightest provocation, she would beat the child until her anger cooled. If she was angrier than that, she would beat him too. She was terrifying in her violence. But even scarier than her was their child. When the child couldn’t take another blow, she would bite his wife’s arm.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He lowered his head and shoveled cold rice into his mouth. He pictured a large golden crown strung with half-moons of blue-green jade. He’d first decided to repair the wall because of the rodents. But now he was beginning to grow excited at the possibility of taking down the garden wall and unearthing a king’s treasure. His house had been built on the flattened grave of an ancient king. There was no telling what lay buried there. The corners of his mouth lifted into a smile. He silently stuffed the rest of the rice into his mouth and thought only of the construction that would begin tomorrow. His stomach was full, but he didn’t feel sated.</p></div><br><br><br>
