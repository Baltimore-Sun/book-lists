Jill Lepore, Harvard professor of history and law, explains why in <em>We the People</em>, the most original history of the Constitution in decades―and an essential companion to her landmark history of the United States, <em>These Truths</em>.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Published on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the nation’s founding―the anniversary, too, of the first state constitutions―<em>We the People</em> offers a wholly new history of the Constitution. “One of the Constitution’s founding purposes was to prevent change,” Lepore writes. “Another was to allow for change without violence.” Relying on the extraordinary database she has assembled at the Amendments Project, Lepore recounts centuries of attempts, mostly by ordinary Americans, to realize the promise of the Constitution. Yet nearly all those efforts have failed. Although nearly twelve thousand amendments have been introduced in Congress since 1789, and thousands more have been proposed outside its doors, only twenty-seven have ever been ratified. More troubling, the Constitution has not been meaningfully amended since 1971. Without recourse to amendment, she argues, the risk of political violence rises. So does the risk of constitutional change by presidential or judicial fiat.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Challenging both the Supreme Court’s monopoly on constitutional interpretation and the flawed theory of “originalism,” Lepore contends in this “gripping and unfamiliar story of our own past” that the philosophy of amendment is foundational to American constitutionalism.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781984855749' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Strong Ground: The Lessons of Daring Leadership, the Tenacity of Paradox, and the Wisdom of the Human Spirit book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1FdB3yaXDL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781984855749' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Strong Ground: The Lessons of Daring Leadership, the Tenacity of Paradox, and the Wisdom of the Human Spirit</a></strong><br>Brené Brown<br><em>Random House (September 23, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Over the past six years, Brené Brown, along with a global community of coaches and facilitators, has taken more than 150,000 leaders in 45 countries through her Dare to Lead courage-building work. In <em>Strong Ground, </em>Brown shares the lessons from these experiences along with wisdom from other thinkers. This is a vital playbook for everyone from senior leaders developing and executing complex strategies to Gen Z-ers entering and navigating turbulent work environments. It is also an unflinching assessment of what happens when we continue to perpetuate the falsehood that performance and wholeheartedness are mutually exclusive.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>With equal amounts of optimism and caution about AI, Brown writes, “I hear a lot of experts trying to soothe people’s anxiety about the pace of technological change by offering platitudes like, <em>What makes us human will ensure our relevance.</em> This is dangerous simply because, right now, we’re not especially good at what makes us human. We’re not hardwired for this level of uncertainty, and many of us feel as if the constant need to self-protect is driving the humanity right out of us. This is why organizational transformation today must foster deep connection, deep thinking, and deep collaboration. We need the courage to lead people in a way that honors and protects the wisdom of the human spirit.”</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Brown offers a broad assessment of the skill sets and mindsets we need moving forward, including the capacity for respectful and difficult conversations, increased productive urgency and smart prioritization rather than reactivity, and strategic risk-taking, paradoxical thinking, and situational and anticipatory awareness skills. She identifies the toughest skill set as the discipline, humility, and confidence to unlearn and relearn.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648212116' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Black Dahlia Avenger: Case Closed, The Definitive Edition book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mrX1Xj5GL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648212116' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Black Dahlia Avenger: Case Closed, The Definitive Edition</a></strong><br>Steve Hodel<br><em>Arcade (October 12, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>James Ellroy once said, “There are some crimes that are not meant to be solved.” (I googled the quote but couldn’t find it, so presume it was something he told me over a meal.) We used to go to dinner at the Pacific Dining Car in LA (now shuttered), a 24-hour high-end steakhouse and cop hangout—sometimes joined by Detective Rick Jackson, who’s mentioned in Steve Hodel’s <em>Black Dahlia Avenger. </em>Ellroy’s kinship with Elizabeth Short, aka The Black Dahlia, was born of his mother’s murder. The retired LAPD detective Steve Hodel’s kinship is more intimate: he fingers his own father as the actual killer. One of the attractions of this relentless, byzantine narrative is Hodel’s restraint; the reader’s knowledge of the unimaginable connection comes not in the introduction but in a very slow burn.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>None other than Michael Connelly, the Joseph Wambaugh of our time, wrote, “Completely convincing . . . As far as I am concerned, this case is closed.” The idea that some cases aren’t meant to be solved might be simply poetic or might be simply true, but maybe not this one.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>This new edition of <em>The New York</em> <em>Times</em> bestselling book includes an updated introduction from the author as well as new evidence and photographs.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648212116' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Black Dahlia Avenger: Case Closed, The Definitive Edition book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mrX1Xj5GL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648212116' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Black Dahlia Avenger: Case Closed, The Definitive Edition</a></strong><br>Steve Hodel<br><em>Arcade (October 21, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>Steve Hodel</strong> was born and brought up in Los Angeles.

That DDA then reviews and makes the legal decision whether to file the case, formally charge the suspect(s), and proceed with a prosecution, or reject it for further investigation or outright dismissal.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I didn’t go to the Black Dahlia Murder investigation—<em>it came to me. </em></p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In 1999, I had no knowledge or interest in “Los Angeles’s most infamous cold case.” I had been long retired (thirteen years), living out of state in Bellingham, Washington, and working as a criminal defense investigator for both private attorneys and the Whatcom County Public Defender’s Office, assisting defense attorneys in court-assigned criminal defense cases.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I had kept my California P.I. license active. That same year, I had recently concluded a major criminal defense investigation that involved a high-profile Los Angeles/Tokyo, Japan international murder known as the <em>Kazumi Miura Murder case</em>. Two defendants, Kazuyoshi Miura and Yoshikuni Okubo, were on trial in Japan for the murder of Miura’s wife, which law enforcement believed was a “staged shooting”—an ostensible “robbery” in the streets of Los Angeles in 1981.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>By 2003, I had completed my four-year investigation into the facts—not theories— surrounding the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short. I had backgrounded myself into her life and movements preceding the murder, as well as amassing numerous witness interviews obtained from LAPD and LADA police files from the 1940s, as well as in-person witness interviews of surviving witnesses from the present.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I presented a forensic handwriting expert’s analysis and opinion that George Hodel wrote the “Black Dahlia Avenger Note” and numerous other letters mailed to the police and press. I also compiled evidentiary photographs related to the investigation and uncovered secret LADA files linking Dr. George Hodel as law enforcement’s prime suspect back in 1950 based on their surveillance of his/our home in 1950.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I submitted my entire investigation to then-active Los Angeles County Head Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay. DDA Kay then reviewed the investigation over several months, resulting in his legal opinion that both the Black Dahlia and Red Lipstick Murders were “solved.” Further, Kay stated, “Were he still alive, there was sufficient evidence to file and prosecute Dr. George Hill Hodel for two counts of murder.” One count against Elizabeth “Black Dahlia” Short and a second count for the murder of Jeanne French, “The Red Lipstick Murder.” (For details, see the chapter, “<em>Filing My Case with the District Attorney’s Office.”</em>)</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>This was followed by both Head DDA Kay and me presenting my investigation to the LAPD.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In attendance were LAPD command officers, including several Deputy Chiefs, the Captain of the Robbery/Homicide Division, and his Cold Case detectives, which also included the then-assigned “Black Dahlia” case detective Brian Carr.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Subsequent to our presentation, Deputy Chief James McMurray, then Chief of Detectives, ordered his Cold Case detectives, “Unless you can find some major holes in Steve Hodel’s investigation, go ahead and clear the Black Dahlia case based on the evidence presented.” During this presentation, Detectives David Lambkin, Rick Jackson, and Brian Carr (who were actively involved and working on the Miura/Okubo investigation back in the 1990s) sat silently in 2003, making no comment and asking not one question. Why?</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>After this meeting, these Cold Case detectives took no action, and when Chief McMurray retired six months later, they had still not complied with his order. To this day, the case remains an “open” cold case. Why?</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Unfortunately, as a retired LA Detective III and then a private investigator for the defense, I was no longer one of the band of brothers in blue; I had “gone over to the other side,” the “Dark Side.” I was considered a pariah, particularly by these detectives, because I overturned their case. A case they, as a unit, had staked their reputation on that Mr. Okubo was guilty. My investigation in the Okubo case resulted in freeing Mr. Okubo, an innocent man, whom they had helped imprison for years.</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>If these detectives had followed Chief McMurray’s order and cleared the Black Dahlia murder case back in 2003, they would have substantiated and legitimized my investigation. This move would have totally removed any doubt as to the factual nature of my investigations, forever blowing up and destroying the idea that Steve Hodel’s “claims are only a theory . . . one of many theories.”</p><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>No, my investigation did not supply a theory in the Elizabeth Short Black Dahlia Murder . . . The facts I presented in 2003 resulted in the LA DDA Kay’s opinion that the case was solved, and the LAPD Chief of Detectives ordered the Elizabeth Short Black Dahlia Murder case “cleared.”</p></div><br><br><br>
