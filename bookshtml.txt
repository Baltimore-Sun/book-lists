Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on many measures. Why?</strong></p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In <em>The Anxious Generation</em>, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the epidemic of teen mental illness that hit many countries at the same time. He then investigates the nature of childhood, including why children need play and independent exploration to mature into competent, thriving adults. Haidt shows how the “play-based childhood” began to decline in the 1980s, and how it was finally wiped out by the arrival of the “phone-based childhood” in the early 2010s. He presents more than a dozen mechanisms by which this “great rewiring of childhood” has interfered with children’s social and neurological development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism. He explains why social media damages girls more than boys and why boys have been withdrawing from the real world into the virtual world, with disastrous consequences for themselves, their families, and their societies.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Most important, Haidt issues a clear call to action. He diagnoses the “collective action problems” that trap us, and then proposes four simple rules that might set us free. He describes steps that parents, teachers, schools, tech companies, and governments can take to end the epidemic of mental illness and restore a more humane childhood.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Haidt has spent his career speaking truth backed by data in the most difficult landscapes—communities polarized by politics and religion, campuses battling culture wars, and now the public health emergency faced by Gen Z.

This question feels increasingly urgent in a moment of cultural and legislative backlash, when widespread uncertainty about the movement’s power, focus, and currency threatens decades of progress.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Sophie Gilbert identifies an inflection point in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the energy of third-wave and “riot grrrl” feminism collapsed into a regressive period of hyper-objectification, sexualization, and infantilization. Mining the darker side of nostalgia, Gilbert trains her keen analytic eye on the most revealing cultural objects of the era, across music, film, television, fashion, tabloid journalism, and more. What she recounts is harrowing, from the leering gaze of the paparazzi to the gleeful cruelty of early reality TV and a burgeoning internet culture vicious toward women in the spotlight and damaging for those who weren’t. Gilbert tracks many of the period’s dominant themes back to the rise of internet porn, which gained widespread influence as it began to pervade our collective consciousness.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The result is a devastating portrait of a time when a distinctly American blend of excess, materialism, and power worship collided with the culture’s reactionary, puritanical, and chauvinistic currents. Amid a collective reconsideration of the way women are treated in public, <em>Girl on Girl</em> is a blistering indictment of the matrix of misogyny that undergirded the cultural production of the early twenty-first century, and continues to shape our world today.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593320945' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Fever Beach: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bXMKgQBtL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593320945' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Fever Beach: A Novel</a></strong><br>Carl Hiaasen<br><em>Knopf (May 13, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“The afternoon of September first, dishwater-gray and rainy, a man named Dale Figgo picked up a hitchhiker on Gus Grissom Boulevard in Tangelo Shores, Florida. The hitchhiker, who reminded Figgo of Danny DeVito, asked for a lift to the interstate. Figgo said he’d take him there after finishing an errand.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Thus begins <em>Fever Beach, </em>with an errand that leads—in pure Hiaasen-style—into the depths of Florida at its most Floridian: a sun-soaked bastion of right-wing extremism, white power, greed, and corruption. Figgo, it turns out, is the only hate-monger ever to be kicked out of the Proud Boys for being too dumb and incompetent. On January 6, 2021 he thought he was defacing a statue of Ulysses S. Grant, but he wound up spreading feces all over a statue of James Zacharia George, a Civil War Confederate war leader.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Figgo's already messy life is about to get more complicated, thanks to two formidable adversaries. Viva Morales is a newly transplanted Floridian, a clever woman recently taken to the cleaners by her ex-husband, now working at the Mink Foundation, a supposedly philanthropic organization, and renting a room in Figgo’s apartment because there’s no place else she can afford. Twilly Spree has an anger management problem, especially when it comes to those who deface the environment, and way too many inherited millions of dollars. He's living alone a year after his dog died, two years after he sank a city councilman’s party barge, and three years after his divorce.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Viva and Twilly are plunged into a mystery—involving dark money and darker motives—they are determined to solve, and become entangled in a world populated by some of Hiaasen’s most outrageous characters: Claude and Electra Mink—billionaire philanthropists with way too much plastic surgery and a secret right-wing agenda—and Congressman Clure Boyette—who dreams of being Florida’s (and maybe America’s) most important politician. The only things standing in his way are his love for hookers and young girls, and his total lack of intelligence. We meet Noel Kristianson—a Scandinavian agnostic injured when Figgo thinks he’s a Jewish threat to humanity and runs him over with his car; Jonas Onus—Figgo’s partner in white power idiocy; and many, many more. Hiaasen ties them all together and delivers them to their appropriate fates, in his wildest and most entertaining novel to date.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781510766969' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713XxaaQHIL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781510766969' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak</a></strong><br>Brian Hooker and Robert F.

Many of us followed the directives of Dr. Anthony Fauci and the CDC: we stayed out of the sun, kept six feet apart, and scrubbed FedEx packages before opening them. Some of us even wore masks as we drove alone in our cars. We’ve come an even longer way since the decades-old demonization of parents who voiced concerns about vaccinating their children. But time (and science) has a way of upending reactive, fear-based narratives and pushing them from the tributaries of conspiracy and into the mainstream.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Like its title implies, <em>Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak</em> is an analysis of hundreds of studies that investigate health outcomes for the vaccinated as well as the unvaccinated. As such, it is an invaluable guide to understanding the current state of science. This book just might alter your opinions molded by state-sponsored, inviolable mantras such as "Safe and Effective" and "Believe the Science," and you may be unpleasantly surprised by the simplest, most brazen fact that the studies included in <em>Vax-Unvax</em> were those that the FDA and CDC refused to acknowledge or do themselves. Historically, what is considered “science”—a word with an often political definition—is later overturned when researchers shine a light on new information. Whether you are a parent, doctor, or scientist, <em>Vax-Unvax</em> will certainly broaden your knowledge and encourage further research. Science, after all, is never settled. It evolves through radical transparency and gold standard research.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>One of the authors, who is now the Secretary of the HHS, just announced that the COVID-19 vaccine has been removed from the immunization schedule “for healthy children and pregnant women.” Perhaps that in itself indicates a desire for further clarity for our medical decisions.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211201' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Stop All the Clocks book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CE5UIAsfL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211201' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Stop All the Clocks</a></strong><br>Noah Kumin<br><em>Arcade (June 3, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>Noah Kumin </strong>is the founder and editor of the <em>Mars Review of Books</em>.

Prior to that it had been a hub for insanity and government-sponsored torture. New York City’s first modern penitentiary once occupied the island’s southern end, and its premier lunatic asylum was built to complement it in the north. Neither of these institutions remain, except as entries in the records of a few historians and urbanists, who might still call to mind all the violence and degradation of the city’s past, its ingrained hysteria, its lawlessness, its frenzies, the squalor of its streets and the ruthlessness of its architects—in short, all that is meant to be banished from sight over the course of its glittering, sanitized future.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The penitentiary was opened in 1832. From the beginning, its wardens found themselves under continual threat of insurrection. An especially vigorous riot took place in 1914, when imprisoned Industrial Workers of the World inspired their fellow inmates to smash the instruments of their prison labor. The anarchist Emma Goldman was a onetime resident of the prison, as were Mae West (sex crimes), and Billie Holiday, who did a few months for vagrancy and dissipation. The penitentiary was demolished in 1939. A two-billion-dollar project is currently underway to construct a multidisciplinary, business-incubating “Innovation Institute” on the one-time jail site.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The lunatic asylum was described by undercover journalist Nellie Bly in 1887 as a “human rat trap.” Beatings and chokings were not uncommon. Residents were stripped naked daily and doused with ice water, for hygienic purposes. Women outnumbered men two-to-one in the institution, as a fair number of them had been committed unwillingly by their husbands; those who arrived sane were frequently driven crazy by the forced doses of morphine and chloral. Soon after Bly’s exposé, the asylum was moved to an even more remote location. But a section of the original building, known as The Octagon, remains: it has been converted to upscale condominiums. It was here at The Octagon that Mona Veigh had come to live in January of 2016. She had arrived seeking quiet and privacy, and present-day Roosevelt Island provided precisely that. No one caused a ruckus on Roosevelt Island, no one wore flashy clothes, and no one made any obtrusive inquiries. It was a place where good-natured families of all ethnicities and creeds jogged happily along the riverwalk, or rode the free Red Bus that wheezed its way every half hour around the island’s circumference. It was a lovely, calm, unmenacing neighborhood where nothing out of the ordinary happened. Mona had come to cherish her life here, in all its magnificent drabness. There were people from her past—in fact, just about all people from her past—whom she meant to avoid, and up until recently, she had been able to convince herself they had never existed. Yet over the past few weeks, due to a series of inexplicable incidents, Mona Veigh had developed the terrible sense that she was being followed.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>On this particular autumn afternoon, a man and a woman in their late twenties—that is, approximately Mona’s own age—had been walking about fifty paces behind her along the water’s edge. Of course there was nothing odd about this fact in and of itself. After all, there was no reason why a young couple shouldn’t be enjoying a stroll on the island, feeling the cool breeze on their cheeks, taking in the fine view of Manhattan’s east side. And yet everything about these two people felt all wrong.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Over the course of her eight jobless months on Roosevelt Island, Mona had become an expert on its weekday afternoon pedestrians. There were the broad-shouldered nannies, shuttling weary toddlers around in high-tech, impregnable strollers. There were the high school kids just out of class, flirtatiously insulting and kissing and slapping at one another. And there were the retirees—the stoic, multi-sweatered, beautiful retirees. But there were no millennials in neon running shoes and expensive hair-cuts and matching wool peacoats. Such people were simply not part of the landscape.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Yet at the same time, Mona had some cause to doubt the soundness of her own judgment.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Much as she had enjoyed her months of isolation, she couldn’t help but feel that she might be losing her bearings. She had, for instance, not been making the requisite amount of contact with other human beings suggested by mental health experts for maintaining one’s sanity. She had not been leaving the island. She had not been bathing as often as is typically considered polite.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Mona Veigh had never been an outgoing or excessively healthy person. She had made her living as a researcher in computational linguistics and got her kicks moonlighting as a scholar of the history of prosody. Neither of these accomplishments, Mona felt, endeared her much to humanity at large. And neither forced her to consort with it much, either. Yet she had made things work for her, in her own way. The company she had founded, Hildegard, had attracted sufficient investment to keep her housed and fed. She was able to devote most of her time to work that interested her. She had even become friendly with a few fellow linguists and literature professors who found her peculiarity more charming than rude.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Then three events took place in short succession that disturbed Mona’s equilibrium, each in its own way. The first was that her company was discovered and eventually acquired by an entrepreneur named Avram Parr, thus making her rich. The second was that under Parr’s leadership she was then given a “team” to work with, thrusting her into a management position for which she was profoundly ill-suited. The third was that Avram Parr killed himself, sending his company into chaos and leading Hildegard to dissolve.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Becoming rich disturbed Mona because she had no use for the money. Becoming a company woman disturbed her because she had no use for other people. And the dissolution of her company disturbed her because, all of a sudden, she had no use for herself. It had taken her months to regain her comportment and get back to the blissful life of solitude she had known before business ventures diverted her: solitary walks, copious amounts of poetry, and the voluptuous sense that she was protected by great art and by her own steely mind from the ugly excretions of the material world.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>This was until two Saturdays past, when Mona could have sworn she’d heard several gentle taps on her door around midnight. She convinced herself that it was her imagination—no one in her building would be calling on her that late, after all—then heard the same rhythmic knocking the following night at the same hour. When she walked to the peephole, however, all she got was a fish-eye’s view of the empty hallway. Later that week, Mona saw an unfamiliar man in a suit loitering on a bench outside The Octagon, holding to his face an iPad that she somehow didn’t quite believe he was actually reading. He appeared again the next day. And the day after that. Mona then began to see him on a bench at the edge of Four Freedoms Park, at the southern tip of the island, where she took her sunset strolls. But she never got a good look at his face, which he always kept hidden behind the iPad. One afternoon she gathered the nerve to approach him, and he leapt up and power walked, like a stockbroker with a deal to close, toward a nearby parking lot, where he lunged into a black Audi and drove off. That was the last Mona had seen of the man with the iPad. But now there were today’s two sinister fashionistas who seemed to be shadowing her every step.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Of course Mona realized it was extravagant to assume that she was being stalked simply because two people behind her were wearing stylish clothes. She wondered if their attire needled her simply because it had hit on one of her sensitive spots. Everything about Mona’s own dress was calculated to render her inconspicuous, yet her very lack of affectation, she realized at some level, constituted an affectation of its own—to the point that she occasionally wondered whether her calculated ordinariness might draw the very attention she meant, at least consciously, to repel. Not helping matters was that she had a subtly distinctive appearance that had nothing to do with her clothes. Her skin was uncommonly pale, and her hair was jet black. With round, green eyes and a small nose, her face might have been plain, had it not been for her expressive, mutable mouth, the full lips of which might curl, depending on Mona’s mood, to give her a look alternately contemptuous or wry. . . .</p></div><br><br><br>
