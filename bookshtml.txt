We’re entering an entirely new era of etymology, heralded by the invisible forces driving social media algorithms. Thankfully, <em>Algospeak</em> is here to explain. As a professional linguist, Adam Aleksic understands the gravity of language and the way we use it: he knows the ways it has morphed and changed, how it reflects society, and how, in its everyday usage, we carry centuries of human history on our tongues. As a social media influencer, Aleksic is also intimately familiar with the internet’s reach and how social media impacts the way we engage with one another. New slang emerges and goes viral overnight. Accents are shaped or erased on YouTube. Grammatical rules, loopholes, and patterns surface and transform language as we know it. Our interactions, social norms, and habits—both online and in person—shift into something completely different.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>As Aleksic uses original surveys, data, and internet archival research to usher us through this new linguistic landscape, he also illuminates how communication is changing in both familiar and unexpected ways. From our use of emojis to sentence structure to the ways younger generations talk about sex and death (see <em>unalive </em>in English and <em>desvivirse </em>in Spanish), we are in a brand-new world, one shaped by algorithms and technology. <em>Algospeak </em>is an energetic, astonishing journey into language, the internet, and what this intersection means for all of us.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211836' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='So We Look to the Sky: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/913CFJlUfUL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211836' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>So We Look to the Sky: A Novel</a></strong><br>By Misumi Kubo, Translated by Polly Barton<br><em>Arcade (July 29, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A bestseller in Japan, this English edition of Misumi Kubo’s first book, <em>So We Look to the Sky</em> (Arcade), is straight up extraordinary. (<em>So We Look to the Sky </em>became a film, and Kubo’s 2015 novel, <em>Goodbye Nirvana</em>, presaged Netflix’s megahit <em>Adolescence.</em>) The author’s hyper-contemporary coming-of-age stories in this acclaimed translation weave—and weld—grief, mysticism, and the cosmic loneliness of the short-distance running teenagers of modern Japan. Think of it as Murakami’s <em>The Breakfast Club</em>, with fewer talking cats and more (much more) raw, tween yearning. The novel is a tapestry of five overlapping micro-epics, with Takumi at its center. When his sexual encounter with an older married woman is secretly recorded and goes viral, the fallout effects the gravitational pull of the orbiting <em>dramatis personae</em>. As is her signature, Kubo layers the story with spiritual seduction—cults disguised as salvation, families unraveling in quiet shame, love that warms like Fukushima radiation—invisible and terminal. Evading redemption and epiphany, the Kubo’s elegant fetish is in presenting the slow burn of transformation. The result is a gorgeous book; but reader, beware, it is <em>unsafe</em>. <em>So We Look to the Sky</em>, without balm or tidiness, forces us to look upward at the infinite vault that is the earthly symbol of Heaven, but where we find only the Void. We are challenged to find our own meaning when standing before its perplexing richness. More translations of Kubo’s work are on the way: the sky’s the limit.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211836' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='So We Look to the Sky: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/913CFJlUfUL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211836' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>So We Look to the Sky: A Novel</a></strong><br>By Misumi Kubo, Translated by Polly Barton<br><em>Arcade (July 29, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>Misumi Kubo </strong>withdrew from junior college and worked for an advertising company before turning freelance as a writer and editor.

Mom, Dad, and I all craned over to peer at the photo he held across the table. When I saw it, I came so close to bursting out laughing that I had to quickly cover my mouth with my hand. The picture showed my brother in a white collarless shirt, a long beard covering the lower half of his face, sitting alongside a plain-looking woman wearing no makeup and dressed in similar outfit. I’d never seen him smiling like that before.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Where is this?” Mom said, practically pouncing at Hinata on the other side of the table, while Dad tried to restrain her. “Where is he?”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“It’s taken at the headquarters of a certain organization, in Nagano.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Saying this, Hinata took out a book from his green tote bag. Just like the book lying on my brother’s desk, it had a photo of that same shady-looking bearded guy on the cover.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“It was originally the Japanese branch of a religious society based in India. Actually, I was there recently myself to look for someone. I just returned.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“When you say ‘religious group’. . . Do you mean like a cult? Like the one that let out that poison gas in the metro?” Dad’s face was sharp and serious as he turned to Hinata, who was sitting next to him.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“I don’t know all that much about them, but their way of life doesn’t seem exacting enough for them to qualify as a proper religious organization. There are similarities, for sure, but I don’t think they have any relationship with the cult that caused that catastrophe. They don’t seem to have an active agenda to change the world or anything like that. The only slightly worrying thing is . . .”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Hinata took a sip of the cold barley tea in front of him, darted a look in my direction, and blushed.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“It’s a little hard to talk about with Yusuke’s younger sister in the room.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He drained the tea in his cup, and Mom topped him up.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Nana, will you go upstairs, please,” Dad said, looking very stern. Of course, there was no way I was going to go upstairs now but I nodded, stood up, bowed at Hinata, and then went out and shut the living room door. I took off my slippers so they wouldn’t hear my footsteps, then moved as quietly as pos­sible to the kitchen, slid the sliding door leading through to the living room open just a crack, and stood listening.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“I suppose the official description would be Tantrism or something similar. Which is to say, they believe in using orgasms experienced during the sexual act to expand one’s consciousness. They aim to utilize orgasms experienced by multiple men and women to release the energy buried inside all of us. The belief is, that if each individual can progress beyond selfhood in that way, then we may be able to prevent the apocalypse predicted to occur in 2035. That’s the kind of nonsense that they come out with.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Neither Mom, nor Dad, nor of course I, listening in from the kitchen, had any idea what Hinata was talking about.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“It seems as though, when they’re trying to lure people in, they start out with environmental issues and so on, the kinds of topics students today are interested in. So they do have some kind of theoretical trappings but, speaking frankly, what they actually do inside those headquarters is just lunacy. Since the former group leader was arrested for possession and cultivation of cannabis . . . there’s been a policy of free sex within the facility. When I showed the photos I’d taken in the facility to people back at school, I was told that the person in this photo was Yusuke, and that he’d been missing for a while and everyone was terribly worried. Most students who make the trip out there leave after the first seminar, you see. This person in this photo with him is the current group leader. I believe she’s the wife of the previous group leader, or at least, they’re married by common law. They say it was she who recruited Yusuke . . .”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>As Hinata spoke, I pictured the woman in the photo. Her long hair was parted down the middle, she was bare-faced, and she was pretty boring-looking and ugly. It was impossible to tell what age she was.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“They say that if the students don’t have any sexual experience, then she initiates them. Sexually. I don’t really know any concrete details. I just know that her role is to rectify all the mistaken information about sex that men absorb through pornography and so on. She shows them how to touch women, things like that. It’s forbidden within the facility for people to form couples, but I’ve heard that Yusuke and this woman are pretty close. Were pretty close, I should perhaps say, because she’s no longer there. It seems like she just upped and vanished one day. There are rumors she’s gone to either Thailand or India. With its central figure gone, I’m guessing it’ll only be a matter of time before the group disintegrates. It seems like the students with no other place to go are still there, living communally. The neighbors are kicking up a fuss, though, and I think they’ll have to vacate at some point. It seems Yusuke just missed his opportunity to get out and is hanging on. I don’t know him well at all, so I’ve no right to say this, but um . . .”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I heard the scrape of a chair, and for a while there was silence.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Would you be so good as to go and collect him? I think it’s better just to go, with no advance warning or anything.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'> </p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>*</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'> </p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Around the time the rainy season was ending, Dad brought my brother back home. Dad said he’d got in the car with surprisingly little resistance and then, in a service station nearby, had wolfed down not just one but two big bowls of rice topped with sliced <em>katsu</em>. Before reaching home, Dad took him to a barber, so when he arrived his hair was as closely cropped as that of the kids in baseball club. The car pulled up into our driveway and the two got out, and then, right in front of me and Mom as we were waiting by the door to welcome my brother home, Dad punched him in the face. He fell to the floor.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Don’t ever make us worry like that again,” Dad said. Then he got back in the car, and drove off back to his work in Tohoku. Without even bothering to wipe his leaking nose, my brother bowed his head in apology at Mom and me, then ran inside and upstairs to his room, trailing drips of blood.</p></div><br><br><br>
