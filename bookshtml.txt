Told with razor-sharp wit and inimitable style, <em>They All Came to Barneys</em> takes us on an insider’s journey as rakish, would-be rocker Gene Pressman and the global fashion industry grew up and came into their own, side by side.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Through back-room handshake deals with designers, days at the haberdasheries on Savile Row and nights out at New York clubs and Paris bistros, three generations of Pressmans—grandfather Barney, son Fred, and grandson Gene—built Barney’s little shop into an empire and a byword for cool around the world. <em>They All Came to Barneys</em> is a front-row seat to the rise of some of the biggest names in fashion (Armani, Alaïa, Wintour, Meisel) and the store that came to dress an entire generation of celebrities, models, artists, and magnates. Set against the biggest movements in fashion and in culture, from the birth of ready-to-wear in the ’60s and disco delirium in the ’70s to the devastation of AIDS in the ’80s and the explosion of globalization in the ’90s, Gene Pressman had a backstage pass to history—until hubris, ambition, and risky business threatened to tear it all apart. . .</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781668076347' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='The Book of Lost Hours book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81kmz3j2gEL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781668076347' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>The Book of Lost Hours</a></strong><br>Hayley Gelfuso<br><em>Atria Books (August 26, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>For fans of <em>The Ministry of Time</em> and <em>The Midnight Library</em>, a sweeping, unforgettable novel following two remarkable women moving between postwar and Cold War-era America and the mysterious time space, a library filled with books containing the memories of those who bore witness to history.</strong><br /> <br /> Enter the time space, a soaring library filled with books containing the memories of those have passed and accessed only by specially made watches once passed from father to son—but mostly now in government hands. This is where eleven-year-old Lisavet Levy finds herself trapped in 1938, waiting for her watchmaker father to return for her. When he doesn’t, she grows up among the books and specters, able to see the world only by sifting through the memories of those who came before her. As she realizes that government agents are entering the time space to destroy books and maintain their preferred version of history, she sets about saving these scraps in her own volume of memories. Until the appearance of an American spy named Ernest Duquesne in 1949 offers her a glimpse of the world she left behind, setting her on a course to change history and possibly the time space itself.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In 1965, sixteen-year-old Amelia Duquesne is mourning the disappearance of her uncle Ernest when an enigmatic CIA agent approaches her to enlist her help in tracking down a book of memories her uncle had once sought. But when Amelia visits the time space for the first time, she realizes that the past—and the truth—might not be as linear as she’d like to believe.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211270' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Waseem: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y-yCjhLVL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211270' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Waseem: A Novel</a></strong><br>Lilas Taha<br><em>Arcade (September 9, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The author of <em>Waseem </em>was born in Kuwait to a Syrian father and a Palestinian father; Taha now lives in Sugar Land, Texas. What does that tell us? Nothing. She’s a natural writer (Hanif Kureishi is an echo, though Taha is sui generis), and may as well have been born in Sugar Land, or Dublin, to Icelandic or Moravian parents; the blood of a natural write will out.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Her protagonist is a disfigured young man who is largely unable to speak or walk. His name is Waseem. About that, Taha is as funny as she is acerbic and tender:</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Should I tell you my name? It’s Waseem. A first-born son, I should have been named Saleem, after my paternal grandfather as tradition dictates. Saleem literally means ‘physically healthy’ in Arabic. The kindhearted neighborhood midwife wanted to spare me ridicule and suggested my parents choose another name. They decided on Waseem. It means ‘handsome.’ Did I forget to tell you my parents had a strange sense of humor?”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Waseem’s in love with his best friend Ameena but she doesn’t know it. The odd couple share a secret ambition––to travel to Palestine, their beloved, unreachable ancestral home. Effortlessly profound, hilarious, and transcendent, <em>Waseem</em> is a testament to the power of love and the unbreakable connection to one's roots, no matter how distant they may seem.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211270' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Waseem: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y-yCjhLVL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211270' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Waseem: A Novel</a></strong><br>Lilas Taha<br><em>Arcade (September 9, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>Lilas Taha</strong> is a writer at heart, an engineer by training, and an advocate for domestic abuse victims by choice. She was born in Kuwait to a Syrian mother and a Palestinian father, and immigrated to the U.S. as a result of the Gulf war in 1990. She earned a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Kuwait university and a master’s degree in Human Factors Engineering from the University of Wisconsin- Madison. There, Lilas met her beloved husband and true friend, and moved with him to Texas to start a family. She is the proud mother of a daughter and a son. Pursuing her true passion for creative writing, Lilas brings her professional interest and Middle Eastern background together in her novels.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“A heart mender and a heartbreaker, Waseem is a deeply moving tale of how life and love persevere in the ruins. Taha is a marvel.” <br /> <strong>—Junot Díaz, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>The Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar Wao</em></strong><br /> <br /> “Waseem marks Lilas Taha as a writer to watch. You’ll laugh out loud, shake with rage, and battle back tears as Taha’s unforgettable protagonist fights for a better life in a Palestinian refugee camp. Like Huckleberry Finn and Scout Finch, Waseem is a character you never want to leave behind—he lives and breathes on these pages, and that’s a testament to Taha’s wonder of a novel.”<br /> <strong> —Ross Barkan, author of <em>Glass Century</em></strong></p> <h5 style="padding-bottom: 5px;border-bottom: 1px solid #000;margin-top: 25px;margin-bottom: 16px">An Excerpt from <em>Waseem</em></h5> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Ameena literally saved my life the day I turned seventeen and Ameena fifteen. I wanted to beat her to our birthday gifting routine for a change, so I asked Nabil to take me down to the alley that morning, and made my way to the market in search of the perfect lollipop. I had some money saved from Yasser’s Eid present and could afford to buy her a modest gift, a beaded necklace or bracelet, but I balked for fear of my brothers and sisters teasing me if they knew. So, I adhered to our birthday celebration ritual with candy on a stick. I chose a watermelon flavor, easy on the pallet, soothing and comforting like her effect on my soul. I was in a poetic mood that day.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Anxious for the time to go by until Ameena came over, I lingered on a plastic chair outside Nabil’s auto shop and watched him and Wael work on—well, mostly under—various vehicles. The shop next door was being renovated. Busy workers trans- ported piles on a creaky wheelbarrow and dumped them a couple of steps from me. Wael shouted at them to watch out, and they shouted back obscenities. I hissed and spit at them a couple of times to keep them at a distance. It worked. When the call for afternoon prayer resonated from minarets, my brothers and the other men headed to the mosque, yet I lingered behind as usual. The alley emptied fast, except for a couple of mothers who went around the corner with toddlers in tow.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Nabil once told me during our bath time that he thought women were lucky to not be required to attend communal prayers at the mosque. He had confessed that, sometimes, he wished he were born female. I remember the expression on his face then. Nabil seemed serious, his kind, dark eyes sad with a wistful expression. A heartbeat after he had uttered his confession, he dumped water over my head and laughed. I closed my eyes, but the sound of his laughter remained with me—a nervous, embarrassed, forced chuckle.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>After that day, his casual following of professional wrestling matches broadcast on television spiraled into an obnoxious obsession. He idolized a particular Irish champion, Devlin, and talked about the tough man’s attributes and accomplishments in the ring to our brothers and sisters, his friends, our neighbors, and anyone who would listen. Never directly to me, though. I memorized the name of the wrestler not out of interest but because of hearing it uttered so many damn times.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I couldn’t reconcile Nabil’s professed sport fascination with his sensitive, quiet nature. It felt as if he worked extra hard to broadcast his captivation and shield his true, tender self from unforgiving camp eyes. But I never revealed my suspicions to him or anyone else. My intuitive brother must have detected my misgivings and excluded me from his zealous ramblings to avoid what he could have wrongly imagined an uncomfortable conversation. We shared no dialogue about his escalating fixation. Allowing Nabil to conceal his kind heart behind the rug- ged mask he created with meticulous efforts was the only thing I could do for him. I, myself, am a master of camouflage. If I failed to detect my brother’s need for disguise, who would? Our grim world left no room for men presumed vulnerable.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A cat grazed my leg and interrupted my musings. It moseyed into the shop and leapt over a propane cylinder to flop down upon a bundle of rags. The scrawny feline winked at me before it closed its eyes. I checked my watch. Schools would let out soon. If I were lucky, I would spot Ameena on her way home if she came up this alley and could surprise her with my gift. Sometimes she walked a different route if she was with friends. Too anxious to sit still, I went into the empty shop, edging my walker around a dented car and an injured motorcycle lying on its side.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A rat scurried across the grimy floor and climbed onto the propped-up hood of the ugly car. Twitching long whiskers, the rodent stared at me. I stared back, repulsed by its stocky, gray- brown body. In a split second, the cat pounced, kicking the pro- pane cylinder. The rat escaped. The propane cylinder wobbled and hit the floor, knocking down a shelf full of metal junk. Car parts and tires flew by my feet and around my walker. The metal edge of the propane cylinder hit a pile of car batteries. Black acid oozed out. An acrid, sulfuric odor stung my eyes. I tried to lift my walker over a metal chain that blocked my way but couldn’t keep my balance. I looked around in search of an escape and quickly realized I was trapped behind the car. The only way out was to jump over a stack of tires. I yelled, hoping someone on the street would hear me.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>There was no one. A pool of acid surrounded me until it ate up the rubber of my walker’s wheels and the soles of my shoes. My legs spasmed, my body shook. I tried to lift myself up onto the car’s bumper, but my useless hands couldn’t get enough of a grip to support my weight.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I screamed louder, out of fear, of pain, I couldn’t tell the difference.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Waseem?” Ameena’s voice called from outside. “What’s that smell?”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Stay away!” I yelled, but only savage noises came out. Horrified, I saw her running toward me, pushing something before her. I couldn’t see what it was, but it was big enough to shove aside everything in her path, creating a loud raucous.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Hurry. Drop in.” She stopped before me with the creaky wheelbarrel from the construction site. I threw myself in, landing on my side with the walker on top of me. Ameena struggled to pull back but managed to wheel me out of the shop. Crying and screaming for help, she grabbed the hem of her shirt and attempted to remove my melting shoes. I howled in pain, as if she were ripping my feet off my ankles. People came running from all corners. I passed out before they reached us.</p></div><br><br><br>
