When he exhibits her as a “wild girl” in the chaotic sprawl of early San Francisco, this golden-haired child without a past will be seen by the populace as a scientific curiosity, a titillating image of female savagery, or, for many, a symbol of the unspoiled body of that young country. For Bird, she is a fragile ward in need of protection, whom he keeps drugged and confined when not using her to further his reputation. But Alice will rebel against Bird’s control, and set herself adrift once more in the surreal landscape of 19th century America—a place no less foreign to her than her own troubled past—where she’ll discover that the freedom she desires may have always been an illusion.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>Alice, or The Wild Girl</em> takes the reader on a voyage from French Polynesia to the terminus of the American frontier, as it charts the unlikely bond that develops between an aging US naval commander and the lost, damaged girl he attempts to “civilize” as a way of alleviating his own loneliness and ennui. Steeped in period detail and layered with fascinating thematic threads, Michael Robert Liska's bold tale examines existential questions about the nature of history, time, and identity, in a vanished America that is at once alien and strikingly like our own.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781668057551' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='The End of the World As We Know It: New Tales of Stephen King&#39;s The Stand book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UALspWnbL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781668057551' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>The End of the World As We Know It: New Tales of Stephen King&#39;s The Stand</a></strong><br>Edited by Christopher Golden and Brian Keene<br><em>Gallery Books (August 19, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>An original short story anthology based on master storyteller Stephen King’s bestselling classic <em>The Stand</em>!</strong><br /> <br /> Since its initial publication in 1978, <em>The Stand</em> has been considered Stephen King’s seminal masterpiece of apocalyptic fiction, with millions of copies sold and adapted twice for television. Although there are other extraordinary works exploring the unraveling of human society, none have been as influential as this iconic novel—generations of writers have been impacted by its dark yet ultimately hopeful vision of the end and new beginning of civilization, and its stunning array of characters.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Now for the first time, Stephen King has fully authorized a return to the harrowing world of <em>The Stand</em> through this original short story anthology as presented by award-winning authors and editors Christopher Golden and Brian Keene. Bringing together some of today’s greatest and most visionary writers, <em>The End of the World As We Know It</em> features unforgettable, all-new stories set during and after (and some perhaps long after) the events of <em>The Stand</em>—brilliant, terrifying, and painfully human tales that will resonate with readers everywhere as an essential companion to the classic, bestselling novel.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781250374042' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Confronting Evil: Assessing the Worst of the Worst book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wHKIbiJSL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781250374042' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Confronting Evil: Assessing the Worst of the Worst</a></strong><br>Bill O’Reilly and Josh Hammer<br><em>St. Martin's Press (September 9, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>A dramatic confrontation with good, evil, and the worst people who ever lived</strong><br /> <br /> The concept of evil is universal, ancient, and ever present today. The biblical book of Genesis clearly defines it when Cain kills his brother Abel out of jealousy. Evil is a choice to make another suffer. As long as human beings have walked, evil has been close by.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>Confronting Evil</em> by Bill O'Reilly and Josh Hammer recounts the deeds of the worst people in history: Genghis Khan. The Roman Emperor Caligula. Henry VIII. The collective evil of the 19th century slave traders and the 20th century robber barons. Stalin. Hitler. Mao. The Ayatollah Khomeini. Putin. The Mexican drug cartels. Collectively, these warlords, tyrants, businessmen, and criminals are directly responsible for the death and misery of hundreds of millions of people.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>By telling what they did and why they did it, <em>Confronting Evil</em> explains the struggle between good and evil--a choice every person in the Judeo-Christian tradition is compelled to make. But many defer. We avoid the life decision. We look away. It's easier.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Prepare yourself to read the consequences of that inaction.

But this childhood idyll was snatched from Clark Fredericks by a man he regarded as a local hero: Dennis Pegg, the town’s Boy Scout leader, a law enforcement officer with the Sussex County Sheriff’s Department, and, as Fredericks would discover, a serial predator.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Through his teenage years and young adulthood, Fredericks kept silent about the horrific abuse he experienced, turning to drugs, alcohol, gambling, and sex addiction to numb the memory. For decades, he remained tormented by shame, unable to share the secrets that were eating away at his psyche—until he violently confronted his abuser.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>At once heartbreaking and uplifting, <em>Scarred </em>is the story of a man who overcame the destructive aftereffects of violence and abuse that nearly destroyed him. Now an advocate for victims and a prominent voice in support of child abuse law reform, Fredericks powerfully illustrates the healing power of love and trust.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648212017' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='I Went to Prison So You Won&#39;t Have To: A Love and Lawfare Story in Trump Land book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71N18jB8fGL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648212017' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>I Went to Prison So You Won&#39;t Have To: A Love and Lawfare Story in Trump Land</a></strong><br>Peter Navarro and Bronnie Brenner<br><em>War Room Books (September 16, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Regardless of where you position yourself politically, it is difficult to deny that former White House adviser Peter Navarro stands on principle. Within these pages it becomes clear where integrity will get you in today’s political landscape: behind bars. By refusing to bend to the Democrats' demands to betray Donald Trump and fight against a right granted to every president before him—executive privilege—Navarro went to jail as a political prisoner. But true to form, within the confines of a Miami federal prison, Navarro chronicles not the days of an embittered man betrayed, but of a man in love and determined to expose a multi-billion-dollar scandal within the prison system.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>I Went to Prison So You Won’t Have To</em> is a priceless collection of letters between Navarro and Brenner, or rather “Huck” and “Pixie” as they refer to each other, that exudes humor as well as honest indignation towards a system failing to enforce prison reform. Navarro’s compassion toward his fellow inmates—which only compounds the character of the man as reflected in his unwavering love for his beloved fiancée—operates as a backdrop for the corrupt origins of his unjust imprisonment. Navarro admirably uses his time behind bars to highlight the indifferent attitudes of corrupt politicians refusing to put taxpayer money to good use or provide opportunities to those most in need.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648212017' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='I Went to Prison So You Won&#39;t Have To: A Love and Lawfare Story in Trump Land book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71N18jB8fGL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648212017' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>I Went to Prison So You Won&#39;t Have To: A Love and Lawfare Story in Trump Land</a></strong><br>Peter Navarro and Bronnie Brenner<br><em>War Room Books (September 16, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>Peter Navarro</strong> is a former White House trade adviser and accomplished economist who found himself on the front lines of a historic legal showdown.

To do so we will read it in the mirror.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He would then ask a boy, to pick, at random, “any article, any article at all.” A report of political rancor would ignite a discussion of Bismark, Tsar Peter, Elizabeth, or Caesar, “playing dominoes with the world.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>That of a grisly murder, Hamlet, Othello, Jael and Sisera, Pinchas, or the Code of Hammurabi.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A bold lad would suggest the sports page, prompting a discussion of David and Goliath, or the ritual sacrifices of the Mayans. Or he would quote from Tacitus on Sport, or the Norman Trial by Ordeal—“those chronicles of single combat, what do you think they were but the Sporting News? And now, read in the mirror, what is the Sporting News but the record of our chosen Knights, their victory proving the personal superiority of their adherents—we that are hus proved the elect of God?”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Inevitably, some lad would read an advertisement, and Fossett would smile and counsel, “never admit you doubt as irrational the Divinity of Christ, or that Mohammed Ascended, upon his horse, into Heaven, you who accept, unthinkingly, that an abrasive sweetened clay, rubbed on your teeth, will find you a mate. Whereby we might perceive a connection between our so-called ‘modern thought,’ and similar magical thinking in the Past, the extirpation of Witches; and various and ineradicable operations of the Pagan mind, still operating in a toothpaste ad.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“We, speaking as a Christian, may believe or disbelieve in the Divinity of Christ, but it is a thoughtless error to dismiss it as ‘unreasonable.’</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“May we rid ourselves of folly? The study of history establishes that we may not. Education exists not to inculcate wisdom, but, much more attractively, to teach the identification of folly. Let us consider it as strategy. Many of you play team sports. Do you not find it helpful, in your football game, to have studied the other side’s strategy? Respond ‘Yes, Sir.’</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Here we do the same.

It is called the Newspaper.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>And here he would assign to each an article, editorial, or advertisement.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“These are the same events, prejudices, and blandishments which have troubled man from the beginning. They have been treated by the great writers of old. Your task is to find whence these plagiarists of today have stolen their material, and explain to our team their crime.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He would then raise the shade covering the blackboard and reveal his “beloved list of fifteen books.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“Human history is the record of sex, violence, sin, treason, perversion and madness. Here” (pointing to the board), “you may find helpful guides to your investigations.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“I am sorry to expose you to the shocking, the salacious, the outlandish, and the cruel. And bid you be strong in your dedication. Spare yourselves and spare us nothing. Tell us about the World.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Fossett was asked, in his last days, how many boys, did he feel, had profited from his unorthodox approach.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“From the study of History, perhaps some,” he said, “perhaps some. From my heterodoxy, I do believe, some greater number.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Our tradition of heterodoxy, of course, dates back to him, and his teaching of Greek.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>His method, so successful here, was attempted and abandoned by the Seven Brothers of the New England Convention.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Fossett had always opposed our membership in “The Communion,” as he termed it, proclaiming that he saw no reason to expand a “Council of Mediocrity,” past that number he could comfortably refute over one glass of bad sherry.</p>p>He held, in hisdefense,andnot unreasonably, that his methods worked, and if their demonstrable success was insufficient to convince the merely theoretical, the inquisitive were welcome to come to his class and watch.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>On his retirement the School did, in fact, join the Convention; and prior to his removal (to his brother’s house, at Leamington), their Board of Governors asked him to attend the Spring Meeting, where they would announce a Special Award, to be bestowed every two years, for extraordinary achievements in education—such to be called The Jellicoe Plaque.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The invitation was replied to by his attorney, who declined “what you perhaps call an honor,” adding that any use whatever of his client’s name would result in legal action.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>From his diary for 9 April 1921, “who would delight in the endorsement of a congeries of fools in Boston?”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He lived to see his methods, long disputed, misunderstood, and traduced, in his final years, endorsed by various panels of educators; much to his disgust—he who famously held that one or two of his boys had “perhaps learned something from a teacher, but who on earth had learned anything from an Educator?”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>His opinions on the instruction of languages were learned, as he said, in “The Best Possible School.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A resident of Tokyo (1892–1895), he learned Japanese and worked as a civilian employee of their Imperial Army as a translator (from the French) of various Military theses. At the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War, 1894, he was offered employment by the Japanese Army, with an equivalent rank of Lieutenant. This they considered a great and signal honor. He declined.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Having accepted employment by the Army he was, he was informed, under law, subject to conscription. He refused to serve, and spent the years 1894–1895 as a convict, “denied the Honor of a Military Prison,” confined in a Prisoner of War Camp outside Kyoto.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>In the Camp, “in order to survive, and, more importantly, to hear the stories,” he learned several dialects of Chinese, “and enough Korean to order a sandwich.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>His quip, “If a three-year-old child can learn German, why cannot I do the same?” was, later made famous (in, he graciously held, “a coincidental spontaneously created insight”), by a famous language school. Fossett denied any credit, holding that the observation was obvious.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>So in the two years of his war, he became fluent not only in the two Asian languages as above, but in the Russian of his fellow prisoners; and was honored by his fellow prisoners for teaching them the languages of the other inmates.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He brought his perceptions to us, and it was indeed a fortunate day when he presented himself here in January 1919.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He showed the head, Jellicoe, the clipping from the Northeast Educator, and announced himself ready to fill that advertised spot (Teacher of Languages). Asked for his vitae he had none. University degrees, he had none. Jellicoe said, “Why should I hire you to teach languages?” And Fossett said, “Because I can.”</p></div><br><br><br>
