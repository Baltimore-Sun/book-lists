Over the course of the year, the unlikely pair develops a life-altering bond, one built on empathy, spiritual reckoning, and heartbreak, with the power to transform Hai’s relationship to himself, his family, and a community on the brink.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Following the cycles of history, memory, and time, <em>The Emperor of Gladness</em> shows the profound ways in which love, labor, and loneliness form the bedrock of American life. At its heart is a brave epic about what it means to exist on the fringes of society and to reckon with the wounds that haunt our collective soul. Hallmarks of Ocean Vuong’s writing—formal innovation, syntactic dexterity, and the ability to twin grit with grace through tenderness—are on full display in this story of loss, hope, and how far we would go to possess one of life’s most fleeting mercies: a second chance.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593712641' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Healthbook cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yf71HxJqL._SY466_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593712641' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health</a></strong><br>Casey Means, MD<br><em>Avery (May 14, 2024)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>A bold new vision for optimizing our health now and in the future.</strong></p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>What if depression, anxiety, infertility, insomnia, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s, dementia, cancer, and many other health conditions that torture and shorten our lives actually have the same root cause?</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Our ability to prevent and reverse these conditions and feel incredible today is under our control and simpler than we think. The key is our metabolic function the most important and least understood factor in our overall health. As Dr. Casey Means explains in this groundbreaking book, nearly every health problem we face can be explained by how well the cells in our body create and use energy. To live free from frustrating symptoms and life-threatening disease, we need our cells to be optimally powered so that they can create “good energy,” the essential fuel that impacts every aspect of our physical and mental wellbeing.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>If you are battling minor signals of “bad energy” inside your body, it is often a warning sign that more life-threatening illness may emerge later in life. But here’s the good news: for the first time ever, we can monitor our metabolic health in great detail and learn how to improve it ourselves.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Weaving together cutting-edge research and personal stories, as well as groundbreaking data from the health technology company Dr. Means founded, <em>Good Energy</em> offers an essential four-week plan and explains:</p> <ul style='margin-bottom:16px;'> <li>The five biomarkers that determine your risk for a deadly disease.</li> <li>How to use inexpensive tools and technology to “see inside your body” and take action.</li> <li>Why dietary philosophies are designed to confuse us, and six lifelong food principles you can implement whether you’re carnivore or vegan.</li> <li>The crucial links between sleep, circadian rhythm, and metabolism</li> <li>A new framework for exercise focused on building simple movement into everyday activities</li> <li>How cold and heat exposure helps build our body’s resilience</li> <li>Steps to navigate the medical system to get what you need for optimal health</li></ul> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>Good Energy</em> offers a new, cutting-edge understanding of the true cause of illness that until now has remained hidden.

He is the founder of the Brooklyn Center for Theatre Research, where his plays appear regularly.

They could no longer process the emotional data they provided one another; they both moved about in a strange lostness. The language they used with one another, their gestures, their touch, all had remained more or less the same; only the meaning, or meaningfulness, had been lost.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The professor’s knees and back felt stiff; his eyes still hurt from staring at his Macbook all day. He desperately didn’t want to have to wake up and teach; he felt an incredible longing to remain at home all day. It had been so long since he just relaxed and read a book for pleasure.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The array of messages and platforms assaulted and confused the brain, which already had its own inborn voices and perspectives—its own warring hemispheres. Modern people could only strive to retroactively make meanings out of scatterings, to fuse hurried improvisations into music, he thought. It was sad.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Dan resented the working conditions of cognitive labor, of content creation: 24/7 focus, one hundred percent response-rate; omnipresence was the expectation on social media (which was torture). He wanted a place for order, solitude, contemplation, self-effacement; he used to go to The Cloisters on the weekends, but he’d stopped doing that several years ago.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>It had become impossible for an English professor to find time to think or read deeply: the irony did not escape him.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>A dumbness rose through his brainstem like sap. When was the last time he felt truly awake? When was the last time he felt like he inhabited the body that carried him from place to place, day to day?</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The kitchen was stubbornly warm. He hated how September nights no longer cooled down like they had in his youth.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>What the body could sense the brain denied. Human cognition wouldn’t act on the sense- data of climate change. That was asking too much. All connection to the mytho-poetic parts of consciousness had been severed. Equinox, solstice: these vitally important days passed by without anyone noticing.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>If the sea rose, the place he was living right now would be under water.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He concentrated on the white spots on his fingernails, bit his knuckle, looked down at the table, at his feet, the floor, as if he were trying to push his eyeballs out of his skull, into the pit of the earth.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He started to think about the $250 check he’d get for whatever he came up with; at worst, he could write something for The Chronicle of High- er Education blog about solitude (or something like that)—the tragedy of distraction and wasted mental energy.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'> </p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Yet another voice told him that the important thing, now, after midnight, was to be productive: to use these hours of forced awakeness, to convert sleep into verbiage, to be a machine. Dan began to type:</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><blockquote><em>There is one political question which cuts across class, race, epoch: what to do with unemployed young men? There is no part of the country—really, no place on earth—where male youths are not alienated and disaffected, and therefore dangerous. There is no place where there is any clear answer to the question about what it means to ‘be a man’—and no place where there is any agreement about whether that question is even worth asking.</blockquote></em></p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He trailed off, bored by the sound of his own “voice.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>There was a dog-eared copy of Henry James’s The Ambassadors on top of the toaster; he reached for it, but then stopped himself.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He’d written about James in his first book (which had been based on his thesis). It had been blurbed by three of his mentors, received perfunctory reviews in two minor journals, and that was it.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>University of Chicago Press. The name still gave him pleasure, even if the press hadn’t really met his expectations. His next book would be with Verso and there was already a contract. Verso understood what he was about. A radical writer de- served a radical press.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Dan spent a lot of time reading comments on his old articles. He was completely invested in the world, the world of argument and counterargument, the thinking that surrounded the think piece, the chatter that grew, centrifugally, around the dim signal of his ideas. Chatter was better than silence: it told him that he was relevant.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He considered topics. Capital? Equality? Bernie? These were generalities, but they seemed incredibly fertile, charged with potential. The cognitive effect of the word “capital” was profound: he could feel his brain activate, neurons start to swim.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Dan wanted to write about hypertrophied, steroidal digital capitalism: the glossy, muscular, unstoppable flows of capital that coursed through smartphones.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The irony was that Dan wanted to sell books and academic publishers wanted leftists who could sell books. He wanted to turn his thinking into information and sell it just like everyone else. He dreamed about quitting teaching, or getting more money for teaching less (a bigger apartment too) and getting a Tesla.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Dan imagined driving to a house in the Hudson Valley with Mariko on Friday evenings; he imagined weekends with vintage wines, farm foods, little gatherings of intellectuals around a fireplace to talk about ideas and events. It was within reach.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><blockquote><em>Why has America self-fashioned as a Christian nation, when it is, in fact, an anti-Christian nation: conditioned to hate the poor, the meek, the powerless? The American right is simply Americanism taken to its logical extreme: the hatred of those who symbolize the ignominy of the $ sign—those who lack it. What unites the Trump and Ryan (the usual alliance of emperors and opportunists) factions is this, this instinctual hate-lust of the poverty-Other. Christian love pulled inside out.</blockquote></em></p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>His ideas, organically expressed, were gnomic and aphoristic. He’d fought this tendency his entire academic career, going back to his first undergraduate English paper. He’d been at his most original then, freshman year, when he didn’t know how to write, and really didn’t know how to do anything except argue with himself, with his own instincts. He wrote by hand on yellow legal pads that he’d stolen from his father’s office.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He was a virgin then, too.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Those were his two dominant memories of the first year at Brown: his crazy, aphoristic papers and his determination to lose his virginity without revealing that he was, indeed, a virgin.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Had he always been trying to deceive other people about who he was? And if so, why? Why couldn’t he let himself be seen? What was he afraid of?</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>This higher-level thought, or self-criticism, never really went away: it was the shadow cast by the quarter-truths with which he constructed his persona. It was so easy to continue as if there was no shadow, as if the quarter-truths were whole- truths.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He’d been in therapy for years—since graduate school. He needed to talk: for hours and hours, for years and years.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The basic position of psychoanalysis was a deeply empowering one. It provided Dan with the space to map his inner-landscape. Therapy gave him the courage to explore the shame which had compacted and crystallized within himself (which he located just below his sternum and slightly above his pubic bone—the node in which all his lived experience was stored like fat).</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He slipped his left hand under his shirt and rubbed this area, the skin beneath his navel, with his thumb, stroking, directly above his bladder, with his fore- and middle-fingers. He did this unconsciously, finding in three-dimensional space that area that he had located mentally, in two-dimensional space.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>He kept typing, as if in a trance.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #000;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211188' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='The Agoniesbook cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41JVZ-lyGVL._SY445_SX342_PQ84_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211188' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>The Agonies</a></strong><br>Ben Faulkner<br><em>Arcade Publishing (March 25, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>When the filmmaker Eugene Kotlyarenko told me about a millennial writer named Ben Faulkner, he suggested I might like Faulkner’s unpublished novel, <em>The Agonies</em>. The director knew I had recently become a consultant for Arcade Publishing, a house that was acquired by the maverick Tony Lyons’s Skyhorse Publishing. (Arcade was founded by the man who discovered Samuel Beckett in Europe and brought Beckett to Grove Press; Arcade also put out works by Octavio Paz and E. M. Cioran.)</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I told him to send it.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>I loved <em>The Agonies</em>. Or rather, was astonished by it. The bildungsroman naturally reminded of Salinger—but eclipsing that touchstone was the idiosyncratic, unpredictable, challengingly simple, gorgeous novel-mosaics created by a towering genius of our time, the Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard. Faulkner’s prose continuously startled and provoked, which was a miracle in itself.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><em>The Agonies</em> is a fearless, poetic gestalt, a New Wave bellwether with the same feel as Bernhard, who, for me, is one of the rare—very rare—handful of authors that are sui generis. In other words, those who cannot be born nor die nor be replaced. Among them are Celine, Genet, and Ben’s namesake, that other Faulkner, William. I was doubly shocked because I had begun to be of the mind that I would never be surprised by the work of a millennial. Forgive me if that sounds arrogant, but at seventy-one, I’ve been around and share the cynicism of my contemporaries. For many of us, American novels have become incestuous—rooted in the cringe echo chambers of academia and careful not to offend.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Ben Faulkner doesn’t offend; his existence is offensive in itself.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>How lucky we are to be so rudely, gloriously awakened from our sleep.</p></div><br><br><br>
