Then one day in geometry class, Nicholas suddenly realizes that his hands are <em>objects</em>. The doctor says it’s just panic, but Nicholas suspects that his real problem might not be a psychiatric one: maybe the Greek god Pan is trapped inside his body. As his paradigm for his own consciousness crumbles, Nicholas; his best friend, Ty; and his maybe-girlfriend, Sarah, hunt for answers why—in Oscar Wilde and in Charles Baudelaire, in rock and roll and in Bach, and in the mysterious, drugged-out Barn, where their classmate Tod’s charismatic older brother Ian leads the high schoolers in rituals that might end up breaking more than just the law.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Thrilling, cerebral, and startlingly funny, <em>Pan</em> is a new masterpiece of the coming-of-age genre by Guggenheim fellow and literary scholar Michael Clune, whose memoir of heroin addiction, <em>White Out</em>—named one of <em>The New Yorker</em>’s best books of the year—earned him a cult readership.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780063305823' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='I Want to Burn This Place Down: Essays book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gRq3o7nQL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780063305823' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>I Want to Burn This Place Down: Essays</a></strong><br>Maris Kreizman<br><em>Ecco (July 1, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>A debut essay collection by the inimitable cultural critic Maris Kreizman—an introspective, searing account of the life experiences that have pushed this former “good Democrat” even further to the political left</strong><br /> <br /> At the heart of this funny, acerbic, and bravely honest book of essays is Maris Kreizman, a former rule follower and ambition monster who once believed the following truths to be self-evident: that working very hard would lead to admission to a good college, which would lead to a good job at a good company, which would then lead to personal fulfillment and a sense of purpose, along with adequate health care and eventual home ownership and plenty of money waiting in a retirement account. Like any good Democrat and feminist, she believed that if she just worked hard and played by the rules, she was guaranteed a safe and comfortable life.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Now in her forties, the only thing Maris Kreizman knows for sure is that she no longer has faith in American institutions or any of their hollow promises. Now she knows that the rules are meant to serve some folks better than others; and, actually, they serve no one all that well—not even Kreizman. Disturbed by the depth and scope of the liberal myths in which she once so fervently believed, Kreizman takes readers on an intimate journey that revisits some of her most profound revelations, demonstrating that it’s never too late to become radicalized.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>With Kreizman’s signature wit and blunt self-reflection,and more than a little transformative rage,<em> I Want to Burn This Place Down</em> is a book for anyone who wishes they could go back in time to give their younger selves the real truth about the fractured country they have inherited—and the encouragement to rebuild something better in its place.</p></div><br><br><hr style='margin-top:-16px;'><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593657508' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman&#39;s OpenAI book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mE0ZASE4L._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9780593657508' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman&#39;s OpenAI</a></strong><br>Karen Hao<br><em>Penguin Press (May 20, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>From a brilliant longtime AI insider with intimate access to the world of Sam Altman's OpenAI from the beginning, an eye-opening account of arguably the most fateful tech arms race in history, reshaping the planet in real time, from the cockpit of the company that is driving the frenzy</strong><br /> <br /> When AI expert and investigative journalist Karen Hao first began covering OpenAI in 2019, she thought they were the good guys. Founded as a nonprofit with safety enshrined as its core mission, the organization was meant, its leader Sam Altman told us, to act as a check against more purely mercantile, and potentially dangerous, forces. What could go wrong?</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Over time, Hao began to wrestle ever more deeply with that question. Increasingly, she realized that the core truth of this massively disruptive sector is that its vision of success requires an almost unprecedented amount of resources: the “compute” power of high-end chips and the processing capacity to create massive large language models, the sheer volume of data that needs to be amassed at scale, the humans “cleaning up” that data for sweatshop wages throughout the Global South, and a truly alarming spike in the usage of energy and water underlying it all. The truth is that we have entered a new and ominous age of empire: only a small handful of globally scaled companies can even enter the field of play. At the head of the pack with its ChatGPT breakthrough, how would OpenAI resist such temptations?</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>By drawing on the viewpoints of Silicon Valley engineers, Kenyan data laborers, and Chilean water activists, Hao presents the fullest picture of AI and its impact we’ve seen to date, alongside a trenchant analysis of where things are headed. An astonishing eyewitness view from both up in the command capsule of the new economy and down where the real suffering happens, <em>Empire of AI</em> pierces the veil of the industry defining our era.</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211126' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='A Woman in the Wild: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Zp9SJKoQL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211126' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>A Woman in the Wild: A Novel</a></strong><br>Tad Crawford<br><em>Arcade (May 6, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Thea is in crisis. Her former husband, Hugh, sexually abused her nine-year-old daughter, Delphina. Thea is a therapist, which makes the deepness of her dread all the more complex and complete. Long before they divorced, there was evidence of abuse—both intuitive and real—that Thea failed to act on. Vertiginous from shame, she leaves her practice in the city and enters a mountain retreat—the Institute for Healing and Transformation. It’s the perfect set-up for a slick horror film trope, but Crawford is far too subtle a writer for that. The “monster” in <em>A Woman in the Wild </em>arrives in the form of an archetypal forest “wild” man who is placed in her care. So-called wild men and women wander the forests of our sleep and our wakefulness, but we rarely let them in. Crawford does that for us, and the result is a revelation. If we let it, the wild part is our greatest teacher. This author never takes the easy path on the way to that healing: “It was easier to remember Hugh than Delphina. Easier to remember Hugh, whom she despised, than Delphina, whom she loved, when that love was unwanted and found no avenues for expression.”</p></div><br><br><h4 style='border-top:3px solid #1c2551;padding-top:10px;'>Book of the Week</h4><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211126' target='_blank'><img style='float: left;width: 120px;padding: 0 20px 20px 0;margin-top: 5px' alt='A Woman in the Wild: A Novel book cover image' src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Zp9SJKoQL._SL1500_.jpg'></a><strong><a href='https://bookshop.org/a/113618/9781648211126' target='_blank' style='color:#1c2551;'>A Woman in the Wild: A Novel</a></strong><br>Tad Crawford<br><em>Arcade (May 6, 2025)</em><div style='clear: both'></div><div style='position:relative;top:-22px;'><p style='margin-bottom:16px;'><strong>Tad Crawford</strong> is the author of the novels <em>A Floating Life</em> and<em> On Wine-Dark Seas </em>as well as <em>The Secret Life of Money</em> and a dozen other nonfiction books.

Whether he refused to speak or had lost the ability to shape words into sound, no one knew.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>After the media uproar—the hyperbolic newspaper stories and earnest journalists on the evening news describing him as dangerous as a beast—it was a miracle that he was saved from the wilderness alive. When pursued, he ran with unnatural speed, often on all fours. The constables shot dozens of tranquilizer darts that missed their mark. In the end, the two that brought him down might have just been lucky shots. In any case, the hunt for this man who kept company with a bear excited the journalists like a pack of hounds. The image of the wild man unconscious and restrained on a stretcher carried by two strong men was broadcast across the country.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Thea Firth watched the interview with the hunter again and again. A strapping man with close-cropped peppered hair, he sat in his study with a scoped rifle across his lap. Behind him, the stuffed head of a buck with six-point antlers looked out from above a fireplace mantel.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>“I saw the opening to the cave,” he said, choosing his words with care. “I wanted to go in but something, a sixth sense maybe, warned me not to. I stayed at the entrance and slowly moved my rifle barrel across the interior. It took time for my eyes to adjust to the light, so I didn’t see him until I brought the rifle back across the cave. Filthy, naked, crouching in the darkness, he didn’t look like a man. He was emaciated, starving maybe, but alert like a wild animal. I was afraid he might rush at me. I kept my eyes from meeting his. Acting as if I hadn’t seen anything, I backed away. I could barely keep myself from running. I’ll never forget those eyes.”</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'> </p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>*</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'> </p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Thea didn’t consider herself a romantic or a superstitious person, but the wild man arrived at the institute near the end of April, on an afternoon flooded by sunlight, only three days after she began her residency. The Institute for Healing and Transformation was high up in the mountains the man had roamed with such freedom. Five large, vine-covered buildings of stone faced a pentagon of grass. Each building was named for one of the great continental rivers—Danube, Nile, Amazon, Yangtze, and Mississippi. The walkways, made of bluestone from nearby quarries, met in a circular patio at the center of the lawn, where a golden sundial marked the passage of the minutes and hours. Built more than one hundred years ago, the institute was a center for retreats, healing, and meditation.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The wild man occupied a small room with yellow walls and no windows. It reminded Thea of the rectangular aquarium pool in which she once watched a ghostly beluga whale swim endless laps. The room had no features except for fluorescent lights recessed in the ceiling, a stainless-steel toilet without a seat, a sink, and a twin mattress on the gray tiles of the floor. A small one-way mirror in the entry door allowed Thea, or anyone, to remain unseen while peering at the new patient. The switch for the lights was not in the room but in the hallway, beside the door.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>The man was near her own age, fifty give or take a few years, painfully thin, barely aware of his surroundings. His eyes, when Thea could see them, looked glazed. The matted mass of hair had been shaved, so his bald skull gleamed in the bluish-white light from the fluorescents overhead. His facial expressions, even his postures as far as she could tell, were distorted from the months he’d lived in the wild with a large bear for his companion. Thea could hardly believe this was true, but eyewitnesses had seen him running on all fours beside the bear. More definitive proof came from an infrared motion-detecting camera a ten-year-old boy had set up in the woods for a science project. In the images it captured, the man and bear looked wary but at ease with one another. They entered and left the area together.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Ordinarily, Thea paid little attention when people would say that this or that event happened for a reason. “If I hadn’t gone to the wrong platform and missed my train, I would never have met her.” “If I hadn’t failed the accrediting exam, I wouldn’t have found my true calling.” Thea heard reason after reason in her sessions with clients. The reasons could be almost a relief. Without reasons, unpleasant and tragic events simply happen. They lack explanation, context. Her work as a therapist convinced her that the essential ingredient of any life is meaning. This was true even when the meaning was that life can be lived with suffering and unbearable losses.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Yet she believed from her first glimpse of this man through the one-way glass that their arrivals so close together connected them. The strong feeling defied her ability to explain, even to herself, why this should be the case. Often, he would rest on his side facing the wall. Staring at his back, uncertain whether he slept, she wondered what images flashed on the screen of his mind. She wanted to enter his room, close the door behind her, and be alone with him.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>This fantasy troubled her. The man didn’t speak. He could hardly move. As the days passed, he remained under heavy sedation. Did she hope to heal him?</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>She had come to the institute needing a time out of time, a vacation from clients and quotidian routines, a period in which little would be demanded of her. She wanted to follow the gravitational force of her energies. Perhaps she would hike up and down the wooded mountainsides like the wild man, find a therapist on the staff and talk her way to a new vision of where she stood in her life, or write down her nightly dreams and use the daylight hours to tease out their meanings. She could sit on a bench in one of the lookouts that dotted the grounds and drift through the landscapes of her thoughts. Even boredom, if she wandered into that vast territory, struck her as meaningful and worth experiencing in its many varieties.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Her status at the institute could best be described as undefined. She possessed the degrees, accreditations, and experience to work as a facilitator and mentor to the individuals and groups who sought solace there. But her role as a resident didn’t require any duties. If she simply needed to purify herself by breathing the clean air, wandering the vast forests, or resting her eyes on the mountains that stretched one after another into the distance, no one would interfere with her. Even the duration of the residency had been left open ended.</p> <p style='margin-bottom:16px;'>Thea wanted to be selfish, to be with herself and ignore the demands of others. Yet the wild man slipped in among her innermost feelings. As she contemplated the progression by which she had come to this place in her life, and to the institute, she would find herself distracted by the yellow walls of that room, the way the man’s fatigued eyes stared at nothing, and her sudden fury at how the institute treated him. Anyone, even a wild man, deserved better.</p></div><br><br><br>
