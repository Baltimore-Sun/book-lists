The Score: How to Stop Playing Somebody Else's Game,Recommended Books,,C. Thi Nguyen,Hardcover,Penguin Press,"January 13, 2026",978-0593655658,"<p><strong>A philosophy of games to help us win back control over what we value</strong><br /> <br /> The philosopher C. Thi Nguyen—one of the leading experts on the philosophy of games and the philosophy of data—takes us deep into the heart of games, and into the depths of bureaucracy, to see how scoring systems shape our desires.</p><p>Games are the most important art form of our era. They embody the spirit of free play. They show us the subtle beauty of action everywhere in life in video games, sports, and boardgames—but also cooking, gardening, fly-fishing, and running. They remind us that it isn’t always about outcomes, but about how glorious it feels to be doing the thing. And the scoring systems help get us there, by giving us new goals to try on.</p><p>Scoring systems are also at the center of our corporations and bureaucracies—in the form of metrics and rankings. They tell us exactly how to measure our success. They encourage us to outsource our values to an external authority. And they push on us to value simple, countable things. Metrics don’t capture what really matters; they only capture what’s easy to measure. The price of that clarity is our independence.</p><p><em>The Score</em> asks us is this the game you really want to be playing?</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KzdBAze1L._SL1500_.jpg

She plummets towards her newest charge, yet another soul she must usher into the afterlife, and lands headfirst in the circular drive of his ornate mansion.</p><p><em>Vigil </em>transports us, careening, through the wild final evening of a complicated man. Visitors begin to arrive (worldly and otherworldly, alive and dead), clamoring for a reckoning. Birds swarm the dying man’s room; a black calf grazes on the love seat; a man from a distant, drought-ravaged village materializes; two oil-business cronies from decades past show up with chilling plans for Boone’s postdeath future.</p><p>With the wisdom, playfulness, and explosive imagination we’ve come to expect, George Saunders takes on the gravest issues of our time—the menace of corporate greed, the toll of capitalism, the environmental perils of progress—and, in the process, spins a tale that encompasses life and death, good and evil, and the thorny question of absolution.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81VEE6-FvlL._SL1500_.jpg
Half-Jew―Full Life: The Unlikely Journey of a Voluntary Jew from Nazi Persecution to the American Dream,Recommended Books,,Georgette Bennett,Hardcover,Heresy Press,"January 27, 2026",978-1949846744,"<p>From Berlin to the Bronx, from Holocaust survivor to American success story, this riveting, fast-paced biography traces the extraordinary life of Gary &ldquo;Pips&rdquo; Phillips who defied the odds at every turn. With an Aryan mother and Jewish father, Pips could have escaped much of the Holocaust&rsquo;s horrors. Instead, he made a fateful decision at age 13 to become a bar mitzvah just as the Nuremberg Laws were enacted, effectively choosing to be labeled a Jew under Nazi rule. Pips&rsquo;s wartime experience is marked by daring escapes, improbable rescues, and survival while hiding deep within Nazi Berlin. Captured four times, he escaped thrice, choosing to remain in Nazi custody the fourth time as there was nowhere to run in bombed-out Berlin. At his place of confinement, he met his future wife, Olga Horvath, who had been imprisoned after surviving Auschwitz and the Death March to Bergen Belsen. After their marriage in chaotic post-war Berlin, they emigrated to the USA to start a new life.&nbsp;</p><p />Arriving in New York with nothing, Pips rose from waiter to co-owner of the world&rsquo;s largest photo agency&mdash;despite never owning a camera. Unlike Pips, Olga was unable to escape the shadow of her Holocaust experiences, and in a horrifying twist, she threw herself off the roof of their gleaming luxury high-rise after more than 50 years of marriage, leaving Pips grief-stricken, but also able to reinvent himself one more time.

Wandering Souls: And Other Stories,Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,Philip Caputo,Hardcover,Arcade,"January 20, 2026",978-1648211584,"<p>The legendary Pulitzer Prize-winning Marine and Vietnam vet Philip Caputo (<em>A Rumor of War</em>) has gifted us with another tender, epic, incendiary work—this time, short stories (happily in vogue again), exploring his major themes: war, love, and the minor and major triumphs of the complex human animal. In its simple, atmospheric title, <em>Wandering Souls</em>, Caputo is in front of the reader, leading them to perilous places both familiar and forgotten, topical and timeless: Vietnam, the African savanna, Central America. His collected work is a vast, haunted river that we have come to call our own. From <em>Wandering Souls</em>: “The monk, hands folded in his lap, began a chant. He sat perfectly still, only his lips moving. When he fell silent, the novitiates took it up. Their call-and-response was repeated again and again, all in Pali, the ancient tongue, Sanskrit given voice. Of course, I didn’t understand a word—neither did Trinh, for that matter—yet that drone, monotonous and hypnotic, seemed to pluck a chord inside me so that I grasped its meaning: it was a chant of lamentation and remembrance and appeal.” Such is Caputo’s work: a call and response of prayer, vigilance, and revelation.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711FGKXeDfL._SL1500_.jpg

After graduating in 1964, he served in the US Marine Corps for three years, including a sixteen‑month tour of duty in Vietnam. In addition to <em>Memory and Desire</em>, he has written seventeen books, among them three memoirs, ten works of fiction, and four of general nonfiction.

He lives in Norwalk, Connecticut, and Patagonia, Arizona.</p><p>“Caputo brilliantly examines the lingering moral and psychological costs of conflict, in which memory functions as both wound and tether. A searing yet deeply compassionate story collection that explores the fragile borders between survival, guilt, and redemption.”<br /> <strong>—<em>Booklist</em>, starred review</strong></p><h5 style=""padding-bottom: 5px;border-bottom: 1px solid #000;margin-top: 25px;margin-bottom: 16px"">An Excerpt from <em>Wandering Souls</em></h5><p>That night, in the tent the doctor and I shared, I cut an Ambien in half with a razor—Ambien was my jet-lag cure—shook out a malaria pill from its bottle, and washed both down with warm canteen water, bitter with the taste of purification tablets.</p><p>“You really shouldn’t mix them,” the doctor cautioned. I haven’t introduced him. His name was Mark Lujan, a New Mexican who claimed direct descent from a Spanish settler who had been among the founders of Santa Fe. It was hard for an old man like me to accept him as a major and a fully-fledged MD; he couldn’t have been more than thirty, a redhead whose freckled face made him look younger still.</p><p>“Lariam can have some weird side-effects, so does Ambien,” he said. “The two together? Not a great cocktail.”</p><p>I lay down on my cot and secured the mosquito net’s Velcro straps to the cot’s poles. “I read the warnings. No problems so far.”</p><p>“Malarone is just as effective against malaria, and no side effects. You have to take it every day instead of once a week, that’s the only drawback. I can start you on it after the Lariam wears off.”</p><p>“You’re the doctor.”</p><p>The camp’s generator thumped outside. A small, oscillating fan, pedestaled on a storage box, swept back and forth. I bundled my clothes under my pillow to make a neck rest, strapped on a headlamp, and opened a paperback, a Michael Connelly mystery. I’d read only a couple of pages before my eyes grew heavy. I turned the headlamp off and fell asleep in seconds.</p><p>I didn’t need the headlamp to find my way to the latrine; a full moon turned the post-midnight blackness into twilight. My shadow as I walked was distinct on the whitened ground, a cutout of myself. I saw them when I turned to start back to the tent: apparitions that cast no shadows but were shadows themselves, upright, definitely human in form but without faces or hair or features of any kind, just two grayish silhouettes blocking my path. Feeling vulnerable and exposed in my near nakedness—I was wearing only boxer shorts and flip-flops—a cry rose in my throat and died there. Sweat shellacked me scalp to toes, and it wasn’t due to the muggy air. The specters began to move away, drifting like fog yet retaining their human shape. Each raised an arm, beckoning me to follow, and I did, in spite of my terror. I could not feel the ground beneath my feet, could see nothing but Chandler and Salerno, or, rather, their spirits. It was as if we three were floating through a void. They stopped, and right then pointed toward the mountains, and I understood what they were trying to tell me.</p><p>Someone grabbed my arm and shook me and called me by name, called right into my ear. It was the doctor. His freckles were plain to see in the moonlight.</p><p>“Hey! Hey!” he said. “Are you awake? Are you all right?”</p><p>Confused, disoriented, I didn’t answer. Looking around, I saw that I was outside the camp, on the road that led toward the search site.</p><p>“What the. . . ?” I started to ask.</p><p>“Walking in your sleep.”</p><p>He’d gotten up to go to the latrine shortly after I had, and had seen someone on the road. Thinking nothing of it at first, he returned to our tent, noticed that my cot was empty, and realizing that I was the figure on the road, came after me.</p><p>“Your eyes were open and glassy and blank. Classic sleepwalker. Lay off the Ambien. Sleepwalking is one of the side effects.”</p><p>We started back. The shadows of the trees, flung across the road, looked like fallen logs missing one dimension.</p><p>“I had a weird experience,” I said in an undertone. “Two weird experiences. Like dreams but I’m not sure they were dreams.”</p><p>I told him about the Wandering Souls and described the brief vision in the temple and the one I’d had minutes ago. “It was so damned <em>real. </em>Not like most dreams, all jumbled up. It was clear as could be. They told me that they’re buried somewhere in the mountains. I don’t mean they spoke, it was kind of like mental telepathy.”</p><p>Lujan mused for a while and gave his diagnosis when we were again inside the tent: Lariam sometimes produced vivid, disturbing, narrative dreams that were, for all practical purposes, hallucinations. He cupped my knee in his hand. “That spooky ceremony you went to, the stories about hauntings and wandering ghosts—the power of suggestion. Stir that in with your pharmaceutical cocktail, and it’s not surprising you saw things that aren’t there.” He stretched his lips into a wide grin, and when he did, he reminded me of the red-haired character in MAD Magazine, What-Me-Worry. He was too young, I suppose, to remember MAD Magazine. “This will stay between us,” he said. “Martha, y’know, was kind of leery about you working with us. That you might have flashbacks or something.”</p><p>“You can tell Miz Prine, no worries about me freaking out, okay?”</p><p>“I’m not going to tell her anything.”</p><p>The doctor’s analysis of my strange visions was reasonable, rational, medically sound; but sometimes rationalism is overrated.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711FGKXeDfL._SL1500_.jpg
