But Alida is something else. The real thing. Traveling Depression-era America from carnival midways to speakeasies, Alida is resigned to an exploited and lonely life on the road as the museum’s golden ticket.

Junglekeeper: What It Takes to Change the World,Recommended Books,,Paul Rosolie,Hardcover,Convergent Books,"January 20, 2026",978-0593980392,"<p><strong>Most people assume that the world has been explored and true adventure is dead: This book is one man’s rebuttal.</strong><br /> <br /> Deep in the Peruvian jungle, there exists a corner of the world that remains untouched—one teeming with giant anacondas, where the haunting cries of howler monkeys send brightly colored macaws shooting across the canopy. It’s an ecosystem of stupendous biodiversity, uncontacted tribes, and adventures that most people don’t even dare to dream of.</p><p>When he first set foot in the jungle, Rosolie was a dyslexic kid from Brooklyn who struggled to graduate from high school but had an undeniable calling to the outdoors. He was lucky enough to meet the indigenous naturalist Juan Julio Durand, and together, over two decades, they have created Junglekeepers, an organization that has found a way to halt deforestation and protect more than 110,000 acres—inspiring millions along the way by documenting their progress online. But this work takes grit, and years in, Rosolie and Durand are past their “barefoot machete days,” grappling with chain saws, massive fires, illegal miners, and the worst of humanity. Here, Rosolie brings you up close and personal with one of the wildest places on the planet and tells the incredible story of “first contact” with one of the most mysterious uncontacted tribes on Earth: the Mashco Piro.</p><p>This book is about the profound power of saying yes: yes to one’s calling, yes to sticking with your dream when it comes at a high cost, and yes to taking a stand to save what might otherwise be gone in a generation. It’s a story of calling, connectedness, and hope.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81AMFKY+9RL._SL1500_.jpg

And yet, in today’s world, that fundamental need is going unmet, with perilous consequences. As mental and social health crises surge, we often blame social media, the pace of modern life, and polarizing politics. But beneath these issues lies a deeper crisis, what Wallace calls “an erosion of mattering.”</p><p>For readers of Brené Brown, David Brooks, and Adam Grant, <em>Mattering</em> is a rare, culture-shifting book that offers both a diagnosis and a remedy. With a clear road map and actionable takeaways, Wallace reveals how to unlock this powerful force within ourselves and how to build cultures of mattering in our homes, workplaces, and communities. </p><p><em>Mattering</em> is both a call to action and a blueprint for living a meaningful life and creating a world we so urgently need.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81W49nFqxNL._SL1500_.jpg

It’s a call to action for anyone who believes that individuals—not corporations or centralized authorities—should decide what’s on the menu.</p><p>If you care about clean food, honest labeling, and the freedom to make informed choices about what nourishes your body, this book is essential reading.

Jamie Rose, an actress widely known for her work in <em>Falcon Crest </em>and the cop series she starred in, <em>Lady Blue, </em>was one of those whom Stutz interrupted.</p><p>But that was thirty-five years ago.</p><p>CUT TO: <em>Now. </em>Rose was a patient first, then rigorously mentored in The Tools before becoming Stutz’s compassionate, experienced colleague (she calls herself a “mindset coach”). Something was missing in the work that she felt compelled to illuminate—the feminine perspective, involving archetypes, meditations, and a ruthless examination of the past and present. Rose has taught Stutz’s methods to countless individuals seeking to break through fear, reclaim inner strength, and take meaningful action. Both workbook and moving memoir, <em>Facing Madame X</em>—a woman’s variation of Stutz’s more general “Part X,” the force that chisels away our confidence, self-esteem, and capacity to love—is not just an invaluable primer on Stutz’s teaching but introduces us to new teachings that are all her own. In the book’s introduction, Stutz pays homage to her perspective.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XTBVh4VlL._SL1500_.jpg

I had money and a house off Mulholland Drive. I’d just gotten married to a successful screenwriter. I was four years clean and sober—and out of my mind.</p><p>As soon as we wed, I wanted to be single. When I got famous from my role on the primetime soap <em>Falcon Crest</em>, I immediately thought <em>film </em>was where it was at. My recreational activity was fighting with my husband and compulsive shopping. I had a warehouse of power suits and shoulder pads; hey, it was the ’80s. At the end of a long, hard, self-obsessed day, I’d hole up in the bedroom with my journal, writing shitty poems that romanticized my fears, showcased my whining, and exalted my anxiety. When I left <em>Falcon Crest, </em>I starred in a cop show called <em>Lady Blue</em>. Six months later, my agent finally booked me on <em>The Tonight Show</em>. When Johnny Carson asked me about <em>Lady</em>, I couldn’t lie. “It just got canceled.”</p><p>All that isn’t exactly a tragic narrative—I get it—but it sure felt like one at the time.</p><p>I didn’t have any idea of who I was or what I wanted. I began to choke at auditions. I forgot my lines and started shaking in front of producers and casting directors. My husband filed for divorce. I was a has-been at twenty-seven.</p><p>I tried talk therapy. When that didn’t work, I did affirmations, chanting, visualization. I saw astrologers and psychics, threw the I Ching and rune stones, had tarot cards and tea leaves read. Nothing helped. Then a friend from acting class raved about a great “no bullshit” psychiatrist she’d had some sessions with—Dr. Phil Stutz. I thought, What have I got to lose? I wouldn’t need to <em>prepare </em>for my role as patient; by then, I had my shrink monologue down, so it was easy. Seeing a new therapist was like an audition where I’d already gotten the part. It was theater; I could do the play for one night only then close the show, or I could have a longish run. My mind, my choice! I went into his office fully confident that I’d wow him. I was blathering about how I’d been victimized by Hollywood, my horrific childhood, my alcoholism, <em>blah</em>, when he interrupted with—</p><p>“Okay, <em>shut the fuck up</em>.”</p><p>My jaw dropped.</p><p>At the same time I felt the shock of his words, I realized that I wasn’t offended—I was <em>relieved</em>. On some level, I knew my endless talking about my problems was killing me.</p><p>Over the next few years, Stutz saved my life. He taught me a slew of techniques that gave me access to forces that helped create real change in my life so I could throw myself out of the endless <em>Why me? </em>loop and get into what he called Forward Motion. As a young psychiatrist at Rikers Prison and in private practice, he grew frustrated with traditional therapeutic modalities; he felt like he was failing his patients. They’d come to him with the same issues and Stutz would put on the costume of the textbook couch shrink, quietly listening without giving direction. He’d guide them back to their childhood, helping them identify the origin of trauma patterns. Eventually, clients would have a so-called breakthrough and see the “connections.” Now that the vicious cycle had been illuminated, they were certain they’d be able to break the cycle. Come next week, they were back at square one. Both Stutz and the people he was trying to help were trapped in the fifty-minute Sisyphean hour. He was at a crossroads.</p><p>Stutz desperately wanted to give his patients something to take with them when they left his office—tangible resources that would bring them relief and propel them forward in their lives. In a creative act of desperation (and revelation), Stutz mapped out what he eventually called The Tools<sup>®</sup>—short meditations that clients could do in only a few moments that allowed them to move from concept to action.</p><p>Immediately, he noticed improvement. Patients began to experience real and lasting change, unfettered by neurotic inclinations and setbacks. He noticed as well that despite their best efforts, many reverted to the same old same old, as if a powerful force was intent on paralyzing them—a force that wanted them held back and broken. I’ve seen the same phenomenon time and again with the clients I work with, and I am convinced that all of us face an unseen but aggressive spiritual opponent intent on sabotaging our growth.</p><p>Stutz called that opponent Part X.</p><p>Long after he moved to Los Angeles, the actor Jonah Hill saw him in therapy. Jonah’s documentary about Stutz was a Netflix hit and brought new attention to his life-changing Tools.<sup>2</sup> Because of his work with those in high levels of the film and television industry, Stutz soon became known as “an open secret in Hollywood.” His methods were simple enough to be revolutionary: Stutz offered a dynamic, results-oriented set of practices that built self-trust and integrity, allowing his clients to handle short- and long-term crises.</p><p>To be succinct, the Tools <em>worked</em>.</p><p>I know this firsthand because I’ve been practicing and teaching Stutz’s work for over thirty-five years.</p><p>A long time after ending our therapeutic relationship, he suggested that I train as a coach who specialized in the Tools. We now present workshops and seminars together all over the country. Apart from that, we are dear friends. Because of our close ties, he’s given me access to material that’s never been publicly shared. My contribution is to actively bring a woman’s perspective to Stutz’s philosophies and practices. While he believes in the power and necessity of the Divine Feminine (and incorporates it in his teachings), <em>Facing Madame X </em>is the first time the Tools have been presented in a way that addresses the unique challenges only women face. That the origin of those methods came from a man is irrelevant; Stutz doesn’t claim ownership. “They come from the Field,” he likes to say. (More about that later.) The Tools are genderless. Having said that, and meaning it, I <em>will </em>add that a woman’s use and interpretation of them are different then a man’s. In <em>FMX, </em>I will also be outlining and elaborating, through a woman’s perspective, Tools that have never before been published, as well as new ones I’ve developed in my coaching practice.</p><p>These pages contain <em>Tools for women</em>.</p><p>Tools for living.</p><p><em>Tools for facing Madame X.</em></p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81XTBVh4VlL._SL1500_.jpg
