Each generation will birth a daughter, lose their love, and, as surely as the tide beats against the rocky shore, take her own life by giving herself to the sea. For generations, the Cole women have lived as outcasts, maintaining a lighthouse on a small island off the coast of New Hampshire. Ever since their ancestor was accused of witchcraft and cast into the sea hundreds of years prior, the islanders have ostracized the Coles, distrusting their rumored magic and their control of the lighthouse.</p><p>Despite their mistreatment, the Cole women are compelled to remain on the island because they know that if a Cole woman does not light the beacon on Juniper Island, anyone who is out at sea will be drowned. Out of guilt and obligation, the Cole women live out their solitary lives on the island, knowing someday their recompense for protecting the people from the sea will be to die in the sea themselves.</p><p>Told in three interwoven timelines in the late twentieth century, <em>The Curse of the Cole Women</em> unravels the lives of three women who struggle with their relationships with each other as they contend with the reality of their fates—is it truly a curse, or is it generational madness that drives Cole women to the sea?</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81dU5gYSdxL._SL1500_.jpg

A Jewish ex-soldier in the Mexican-American War, Stokes becomes a highwayman and buffalo hunter in the (ultra-)Wild West. Artfully and inexorably interwoven with the life of Stokes is that of former slave Raleigh Bodkin, who along with his sister was deeded equal shares of a failing plantation in Virginia. When enraged neighbors burn down their legacy home, brother and sister escape, but are separated.</p><p>Watman’s gift is to alternate both astonishing narratives—of Jed and of Raleigh and his sister—before the two men unite in a heart-stopping mission of justice, rescue, and revenge. <em>Tomorrow, the War </em>ends at the Battle of Bull Run, a set piece that isn’t for the faint-hearted. But Watman was never courting that kind of audience anyway.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618N57Wy7WL._SL1500_.jpg

The two men closest to the man now on the ground were on their knees. A white man rushed forth from the gate and brought the butt of his whip down hard on the fallen man’s head.</p><p>“Hey, now, these is purchased and paid for goods. These boys is worth money! Get them on the boat in one piece!”</p><p>The man with the whip pulled the fallen man up, taunting him. The black men were naked. They didn’t look up.</p><p>A man on a nervous filly rode out of the gate, having a hard time keeping her on task. She skittered on the cobbles, drifting and turning. She didn’t like the sound of the whip or the smell of fear in the air.</p><p>A lantern appeared on the deck of a ship, and the twenty captives trudged across the road toward its inconstant light.</p><p>The horseman and his partner stayed on the shore.</p><p>The black men stopped on the gangplank, their chains thudded together like a terrifying drum.</p><p>“C’mon! This way!” called the man on the boat. “C’mon, move!”</p><p>But the black men didn’t move.</p><p>“Move, damn you!” cried the man standing on the shore.</p><p>The filly skittered sideways.</p><p>One of the chained called out: “Has the bell rung?”</p><p>In unison, the reply came: “The bell done rung!”</p><p>“I said, ‘has the bell rung?’” His voice was strong.</p><p>The filly was spinning around. The man standing on the shore reached for the pistol stuck in his belt.</p><p>Again, the choir: “The bell done rung.”</p><p>The big voice of the leader boomed: “I stand on a sea of glass and fire!”</p><p>The black men took one step to the right, all of them. The chains clunked and the choir answered: “The bell done rung!”</p><p>Again the leader boomed: “And the lord gonna lift my soul up higher!”</p><p>“The bell done rung!”</p><p>They took a step to the left, as one. The chains were heavy and the sound they made was dull and thick. As one, the twenty plunged off the side of the gangplank and into the water. They did not shout or try to catch themselves.</p><p>They had found a moment of freedom in the space between the shore and the boat, and they had decided to stay there.</p><p>The surface erupted into sprays, and the river gave a deep, reverberating thunk. The chains pulled the men down, and foamy ripples broke against the hulls of the docked boats.</p><p>The filly broke and ran, eyes bulging, lunging while the man astride her pulled on her reins, feet thrust forward now to better leverage everything he had against the animal. He was screaming, cussing, and the filly was swinging her head back and forth, trying to shake the bit out of her mouth. With each bound forward she gained momentum, until she crashed straight into a wrought iron fence. The rider flew out of the saddle, headlong over the iron fence, and smacked against the bricks of the building behind it. He flopped to the ground, his body at unnatural angles, bleeding from his head.</p><p>There were bubbles rising in the river.</p><p>Jed was breathing hard.</p><p>He blinked and tried to will the whole thing away. He crossed the street and stared into the slow swirl of the river, brown and thick. There were no more bubbles rising from the dead, chained together on the river’s floor.</p><p>Jed turned and looked at the broken man dying against the brick wall, and saw blood in a pool under his ruined form. He looked at the lantern on the boat.</p><p>He didn’t want to be here when the men came back.</p><p>He walked upstream, heading west, disgusted.</p><p>The wind picked up as he walked, and the bluster was formidable by the time Jed made it to his burrow. Looking south he saw black clouds in the dawn light. The river was roiling and frothed. The wind came in gusts on top of a persistent, relentless blow. He stood at the edge of the cliff, then squatted to lessen the blows of the buffeting wind. It wasn’t raining, yet, or not raining much, more like the wind was just pushing water around in the air—he’d find his cheek was damp, but there were no raindrops. The trees behind him creaked like the old chairs on Tomlinson’s porch back in Alcott’s Brook.</p><p>He ducked into the shelter of the chestnut and huddled against the root ball. The trunk was wide enough to cover him, and he’d swept the dirt up until it had formed rough mud walls. He watched the thin branches on either side of the tree whip in the wind.</p><p>When the rain came, it hit hard. Now there was thunder, and sheets of water. Trees bent, and he heard branches snap, then boughs, then the rushing tumble of whole trunks ripped from the ground. Water seeped in, muddying his floor. He took up his things and held them in his lap, hoping that the pallet he sat upon would be tall enough to keep him from sinking into the mud.</p><p>Every time Jed felt that the storm had reached its maximum power and would soon dissipate, it grew in strength. The wind lifted trees from the mud and threw them against the forest floor. The rain came now like a wave, a waterfall. The storm raged without cessation, without respite. Jed cowered in his den, whimpering. Surely this was biblical. Surely this was the end of the world.</p><p>He had almost forgotten words, had Jed. His thoughts, so immediate for so long, had barely resembled language. They were impulsive, instinctual flashes that led to immediate action meant to preserve him and the small order which he imposed upon his world. Now, language overtook him. He was aware, for the first time in weeks, months, of how alive he was. He cried out and felt his voice tiny in the battering forces of nature.</p><p>“What is this storm, then?” he asked, “if not a reckoning? Those black men sang out their last and plunged to their death and brought forth this. Their chant called forth some judgment. They sang out, and the bell they cried for has now rung. Why have I been included in this? Am I to be washed away?”</p><p>If it was time, he thought, he wanted to be neither sheep nor goat. He felt neither was accurate. He’d had nothing with which to grant comfort, nor anything to deny anyone. Who had he turned away? No one. He’d moved from his mountain, to this hill, and he’d lived as sealed and quiet and alone as a man might live. These thoughts poured through him like prayers. He was terrified.</p><p>A tree fell across the great chestnut under which he huddled, and the tree shook but didn’t move.</p><p>What do I have to do with this? It isn’t my doing that cracked the sky open.</p><p>He saw, by the way the tree had fallen across the chestnut, that it had formed another layer of protection and cover. He wondered if the destructive force that whipped such fury all around had heard him and agreed. This vengeance—how could it be anything else?—was not against him.</p><p>At sunset, the clouds broke, and the storm ceased. He crawled out through the branches of the tree that had fallen across his chestnut. The sunset was glorious, streaks of color shot across the sky. He’d survived.</p><p>He gathered his things, inventoried them, and walked into Richmond.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618N57Wy7WL._SL1500_.jpg
