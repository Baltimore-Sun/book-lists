Set against the biggest movements in fashion and in culture, from the birth of ready-to-wear in the ’60s and disco delirium in the ’70s to the devastation of AIDS in the ’80s and the explosion of globalization in the ’90s, Gene Pressman had a backstage pass to history—until hubris, ambition, and risky business threatened to tear it all apart. . .</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cEKBfVneL._SL1500_.jpg

She’s a natural writer (Hanif Kureishi is an echo, though Taha is sui generis), and may as well have been born in Sugar Land, or Dublin, to Icelandic or Moravian parents; the blood of a natural write will out.</p> <p>Her protagonist is a disfigured young man who is largely unable to speak or walk. His name is Waseem. About that, Taha is as funny as she is acerbic and tender:</p> <p>“Should I tell you my name? It’s Waseem. A first-born son, I should have been named Saleem, after my paternal grandfather as tradition dictates. Saleem literally means ‘physically healthy’ in Arabic. The kindhearted neighborhood midwife wanted to spare me ridicule and suggested my parents choose another name. They decided on Waseem. It means ‘handsome.’ Did I forget to tell you my parents had a strange sense of humor?”</p> <p>Waseem’s in love with his best friend Ameena but she doesn’t know it. The odd couple share a secret ambition––to travel to Palestine, their beloved, unreachable ancestral home. Effortlessly profound, hilarious, and transcendent, <em>Waseem</em> is a testament to the power of love and the unbreakable connection to one's roots, no matter how distant they may seem.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y-yCjhLVL._SL1500_.jpg

I wanted to beat her to our birthday gifting routine for a change, so I asked Nabil to take me down to the alley that morning, and made my way to the market in search of the perfect lollipop. I had some money saved from Yasser’s Eid present and could afford to buy her a modest gift, a beaded necklace or bracelet, but I balked for fear of my brothers and sisters teasing me if they knew. So, I adhered to our birthday celebration ritual with candy on a stick. I chose a watermelon flavor, easy on the pallet, soothing and comforting like her effect on my soul. I was in a poetic mood that day.</p> <p>Anxious for the time to go by until Ameena came over, I lingered on a plastic chair outside Nabil’s auto shop and watched him and Wael work on—well, mostly under—various vehicles. The shop next door was being renovated. Busy workers trans- ported piles on a creaky wheelbarrow and dumped them a couple of steps from me. Wael shouted at them to watch out, and they shouted back obscenities. I hissed and spit at them a couple of times to keep them at a distance. It worked. When the call for afternoon prayer resonated from minarets, my brothers and the other men headed to the mosque, yet I lingered behind as usual. The alley emptied fast, except for a couple of mothers who went around the corner with toddlers in tow.</p> <p>Nabil once told me during our bath time that he thought women were lucky to not be required to attend communal prayers at the mosque. He had confessed that, sometimes, he wished he were born female. I remember the expression on his face then. Nabil seemed serious, his kind, dark eyes sad with a wistful expression. A heartbeat after he had uttered his confession, he dumped water over my head and laughed. I closed my eyes, but the sound of his laughter remained with me—a nervous, embarrassed, forced chuckle.</p> <p>After that day, his casual following of professional wrestling matches broadcast on television spiraled into an obnoxious obsession. He idolized a particular Irish champion, Devlin, and talked about the tough man’s attributes and accomplishments in the ring to our brothers and sisters, his friends, our neighbors, and anyone who would listen. Never directly to me, though. I memorized the name of the wrestler not out of interest but because of hearing it uttered so many damn times.</p> <p>I couldn’t reconcile Nabil’s professed sport fascination with his sensitive, quiet nature. It felt as if he worked extra hard to broadcast his captivation and shield his true, tender self from unforgiving camp eyes. But I never revealed my suspicions to him or anyone else. My intuitive brother must have detected my misgivings and excluded me from his zealous ramblings to avoid what he could have wrongly imagined an uncomfortable conversation. We shared no dialogue about his escalating fixation. Allowing Nabil to conceal his kind heart behind the rug- ged mask he created with meticulous efforts was the only thing I could do for him. I, myself, am a master of camouflage. If I failed to detect my brother’s need for disguise, who would? Our grim world left no room for men presumed vulnerable.</p> <p>A cat grazed my leg and interrupted my musings. It moseyed into the shop and leapt over a propane cylinder to flop down upon a bundle of rags. The scrawny feline winked at me before it closed its eyes. I checked my watch. Schools would let out soon. If I were lucky, I would spot Ameena on her way home if she came up this alley and could surprise her with my gift. Sometimes she walked a different route if she was with friends. Too anxious to sit still, I went into the empty shop, edging my walker around a dented car and an injured motorcycle lying on its side.</p> <p>A rat scurried across the grimy floor and climbed onto the propped-up hood of the ugly car. Twitching long whiskers, the rodent stared at me. I stared back, repulsed by its stocky, gray- brown body. In a split second, the cat pounced, kicking the pro- pane cylinder. The rat escaped. The propane cylinder wobbled and hit the floor, knocking down a shelf full of metal junk. Car parts and tires flew by my feet and around my walker. The metal edge of the propane cylinder hit a pile of car batteries. Black acid oozed out. An acrid, sulfuric odor stung my eyes. I tried to lift my walker over a metal chain that blocked my way but couldn’t keep my balance. I looked around in search of an escape and quickly realized I was trapped behind the car. The only way out was to jump over a stack of tires. I yelled, hoping someone on the street would hear me.</p> <p>There was no one. A pool of acid surrounded me until it ate up the rubber of my walker’s wheels and the soles of my shoes. My legs spasmed, my body shook. I tried to lift myself up onto the car’s bumper, but my useless hands couldn’t get enough of a grip to support my weight.</p> <p>I screamed louder, out of fear, of pain, I couldn’t tell the difference.</p> <p>“Waseem?” Ameena’s voice called from outside. “What’s that smell?”</p> <p>“Stay away!” I yelled, but only savage noises came out. Horrified, I saw her running toward me, pushing something before her. I couldn’t see what it was, but it was big enough to shove aside everything in her path, creating a loud raucous.</p> <p>“Hurry. Drop in.” She stopped before me with the creaky wheelbarrel from the construction site. I threw myself in, landing on my side with the walker on top of me. Ameena struggled to pull back but managed to wheel me out of the shop. Crying and screaming for help, she grabbed the hem of her shirt and attempted to remove my melting shoes. I howled in pain, as if she were ripping my feet off my ankles. People came running from all corners. I passed out before they reached us.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y-yCjhLVL._SL1500_.jpg
