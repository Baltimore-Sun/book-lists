Susan Southard has spent years interviewing <em>hibakusha</em> (“bomb-affected people”) and researching the physical, emotional, and social challenges of post-atomic life. She weaves together dramatic eyewitness accounts with searing analysis of the policies of censorship and denial that colored much of what was reported about the bombing both in the United States and Japan.</p> <p>A gripping narrative of human resilience, <em>Nagasaki</em> will help shape public discussion and debate over one of the most controversial wartime acts in history.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81+zl-mHZxL._SL1500_.jpg

"Scraps, Orts, and Fragments: Pieces of a Life",Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,Micahel Rosenthal,Hardcover,Arcade,"May 6, 2025",978-1648211461,"<p>The storied author and Guggenheim Fellow Michael Rosenthal gives us a jewel-box memoir of New York at a time when we really <em>need</em> a jewel-box memoir of New York. And if you’re wondering what the hell an <em>Ort</em> is, I’ll tell you: a scrap or remainder of food from a meal. <em>Scrap, Orts, and Fragments </em>is a moveable, bite-sized feast.</p> <p>If a longish sentence in the preface of this expansive yet tightly written book doesn’t immediately get your attention, nothing will: “My enthusiasm for Hubert’s flea circus, our punchball games in front of my father’s medical office on Ninety-first Street, my first job as a janitor following college graduation, starting my administrative career amid the shooting of the dean of students in the office next to mine, immersion in a post–heart surgery paranoid-schizophrenic haze, being appointed to the board of directors of a New York Stock Exchange company—none of these are intended to fit into a neat pattern.”</p> <p>Rosenthal looks back, not in anger, but in a warmly mystic simplicity on how things used to be. <em>And </em>the man still has a weekly table at East Harlem’s <em>Rao’s</em>, a steakhouse that even Bill Gates might have trouble getting into. Quoting Rosenthal, who’s quoting Montaigne: “This, reader, is an honest book.”</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714EhDfZE8L._SL1500_.jpg

Mom, on more than one occasion, warned me never <em>ever </em>to be in the same room with a Ouija board . . .</p> <p>Dad had rituals of his own that revealed superstitious impulses. Having special shirts and underwear he’d wear to work when he was “slumping,” which is to say, not selling a sufficient number of motor vehicles. He’d also repeatedly made clear to me: “Don’t talk bad about people. Whatever you say about others will happen to you. Life has a way of catching up with you.” Which, I don’t really see why this would be true, but in my biased (so often fooled by randomness!) mind, it seems to happen quite often.</p> <p>And this, more so than my mom’s warning against Ouijas, bounced around in my mind in the moments after Madison (the woman I met on the unprotected sex app) crudely stormed out of my apartment and called me “a truly, deeply pathetic guy” and a “coward the likes of which the world has never seen,” and said that I would “pay” for what I “did to her.” Despite my best efforts to seem unfazed by and unconcerned with the opinions of others (to an arguably pathological level), for the past few days I’ve found myself fixating on my near-sex-experience, and its resolution. How harsh the sound of her slamming my door was—it seemed she really put the full strength of her large left arm into pulling it shut, a final tantrum meant to torture me after I broke the news (“We absolutely will not be having sex, unprotected or otherwise. Now, I kindly ask you to leave”) to her and sent her out into a car I’d ordered for her on an app on my phone.</p> <p>And as an immediate consequence of her slamming shut my front door (due to my refusal to give her <em>every piece</em> of me . . .), my glass-encased <em>mezuzah </em>lost its connection to the upper right corner of my doorframe and fell to the floor, fracturing into three large pieces. “Well that’s inauspicious,” I said aloud in the voice I often use when there’s no one around to hear me. “I don’t even know what a mezuzah’s for!” I exclaimed exasperatedly, again, to no one but myself.</p> <p>But I knew I didn’t like the idea of mine falling on the floor and breaking, especially because this had been given to me by my Bubbe, who told me to bring it with me to New York City, and touch it sometimes when I walked through the door, and then kiss my fingers after I touched it. And I actually <em>did </em>do this. Probably two or three times a week before that woman slammed my door shut and caused it to fall to the floor and break. But still, in the immediate aftermath of its breaking, I thought very little of it, instead focusing on trying to replay this negative interaction I’d just had with M (Madison).</p> <p>For eighty-eight hours straight, I holed up in my apartment, lying around in bed, barely moving, only taking one shower a day, subsisting on nothing but low-carb protein bars and this new dissolvable “Greens” powder that claimed to contain a day’s servings of vegetables (and fruits) in every scoop. I simply wasn’t myself—my usual cool and unaffected self. During this seclusion, I accomplished absolutely nothing of productive value. . .</p> <p>. . . At 12 p.m., after three days inside, I came out of hiding, convinced of this perspective: that it was wrong to be Ross. I ran down the stairs of my building in a frenzy, in a truly manic mood, ready to do something drastic. I got out onto the cloudy autumn streets of Roosevelt Island and marched intently toward the Bread N Butter Market, one of a small handful of convenience stores located on the island. I walked up to the counter and the man began shaking his head at me: “No bathroom! No bathroom!” he kept saying.</p> <p>“No bathroom! No bathroom!” I replied in agreement, raising my arms and straightening my fingers as if to signal, <em>don’t shoot!</em></p> <p>“Here to buy cigarette,” I added, leaving off the letter ‘s’ in <em>cigarettes</em> because I thought it would help him understand me better.</p> <p>“You? Cigarette?” he asked, nearly erupting with incredulous laughter.</p> <p>“Yes, <em>me</em>, cigarette. Marlboro <em>Lights</em>, in fact! One pack, please,” I added, even though I didn’t really understand what a “light” cigarette was or could be.</p> <p>The man behind the counter handed me this golden pack of smokes, and I tapped my Watch against a point of sale (POS) terminal until it buzzed slightly, giving me a haptic indication that my credit card had been charged for this pack of cigarettes. On the box, I read the words “LOW TAR &amp; NICOTINE,” which sounded reasonable enough to me. . .</p> <p>I peeled back the lid on the cigs, took one out, and held it in my hand, already feeling cool, fiddling and fidgeting with it. It was going to be perfect. I put it back into the pack and the pack into my jacket pocket and waved hello to my doorman and walked into the elevator up to my apartment.</p> <p>Calmer, now that I’d made my purchase and conceived of an escape hatch from my citadel of suffocating sobriety, I sat down on my green loveseat and again picked up the pack of smokes, pulling them out of my pocket and up to eye level. “Your golden ticket, Ross,” I said to myself. “Why not have one right now? Smoke indoors, that way your whole apartment stinks of smoke and people think you’re a laid-back <em>Bohemian</em>?” The idea wasn’t half bad. I could smoke inside my apartment, hotbox the place, and then people (women) would come over and fancy me a carefree artistic type, living a relaxed island lifestyle of cigarette smoking and casual (yet passionate) romance.</p> <p>I plucked a single fag out of the box and with two fingers, held it up to my lips, miming my eventual first inhalation while watching an online video titled “HOW TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE (FULL TUTORIAL)” with over nine hundred thousand views. Empowering. I could really feel it: the entire world at my fingertips. But at about two minutes into the six-minute video, as I attempted to follow along, I realized I had neglected to purchase any lighters or matches from the man at the Bread N Butter Market. Typical, idiotic, forgetful Ross. You could have all the light cigarettes in the world, but without a lighter, they were useless! Perhaps I had a lighter, left behind from Lora or for candles or something. Or some matches taken from the maître d’ desk at a fancy restaurant. I walked over to my “junk drawer,” silently asking “please let there be something in here . . .” (although I’m not sure to whom) and instead only found a tangled nest of weird wires, several batteries of dubious levels of charge, and the three fractured pieces of my <em>mezuzah </em>which I couldn’t bring myself to throw out after it had shattered several days earlier.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714EhDfZE8L._SL1500_.jpg
