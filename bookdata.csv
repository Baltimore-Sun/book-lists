Rose,Hardcover,Regnery,"January 27, 2026",978-1510786127,"<p><strong><em>The Subversive Art of a Classical Education</em> is a bold call to reclaim traditional education as a radical act of cultural resistance, forming minds and souls for wisdom in an age of distraction and decline</strong><br /> <br /> In an age obsessed with screens, speed, and skills, <em>The Subversive Art of a Classical Education</em> delivers a bold, timely manifesto for reclaiming education as a deeply human pursuit. Veteran educator and bestselling author Michael S. Rose makes the compelling case that classical education is not just an academic alternative—but a revolutionary act of cultural defiance.</p><p>Drawing on over two decades of experience, Rose reveals how traditional practices—grammar, logic, rhetoric, memorization, handwriting, slow reading, and the liberal arts—foster attention, discernment, and wisdom in a distracted world. Each chapter explores how these time-honored disciplines develop intellectual and moral virtues now endangered by modern education’s utilitarian and technological focus.</p><p><em>The Subversive Art of a Classical Education</em> calls on parents, teachers, and thinkers to reject the reduction of students into data points and rediscover the transformative power of real learning. This book is a rallying cry for those ready to resist the flattening forces of modernity and form souls capable of freedom, depth, and meaning.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717oj0ljLBL._SL1500_.jpg
Departure(s): A Novel,Recommended Books,,Julian Barnes,Hardcover,Knopf,"January 20, 2026",978-0593804506,"<p><strong>On the occasion of his eightieth birthday, one of our great novelists delivers a playful and profound work about memory, love, and the writer's endgame.</strong><br /> <br /> Shortly after our narrator, a writer named Julian, begins this compact book by discussing the workings of involuntary memory, he interrupts himself with a bulletin to the reader: ""There will be a story—or a story within the story—but not just yet.”</p><p>Of course, whether <em>Departure(s)</em> is mostly fiction or not, there is a lot of its author in it, including Barnes's reckoning with the blood disorder he has been living with since he was diagnosed in 2020, his long preoccupation with dying and grief, and his mordant sense of the indignities and lost opportunities we're prey to in love. The story he promises to deliver is a love story, that of two friends he met at university in the 1960s, that time of touted but rarely experienced sexual freedom. Julian played matchmaker to Stephen and Jean; as the third wheel he was deeply invested in the success of their love and insulted when they broke up. Time is swift, and forty years later, he tries again, watching as their rekindled affair produces joys, betrayals, and disappointments of a different order.</p><p>""Life and memory can be so . . . quixotic, don't you find?"" Barnes uses both his novelistic memory and his (real?) personal diary entries to examine not just the quixotic relationship of Jean and Stephen but his writer's eye upon it, and how his efforts in their behalf add up in the end. Having promised them he'd never write about them, he breaks the promise to fulfill one, amply, to his readers, in this delightful and poignant novelist’s game that only Julian Barnes knows how to play.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GV+8rOfwL._SL1500_.jpg

Catherine and Bud's open marriage has reached its breaking point as their daughters spiral in their own chaotic orbits: Abigail, the eldest, is dating a man in his twenties nicknamed War Crime Wes; Louise, the middle child, maintains a secret correspondence with an online terrorist; the brilliant youngest, Harper, is being sent to wilderness reform camp due to her insistence that someone―or something―is monitoring the town’s citizens.</p><p>Casting a shadow across their lives, and their small coastal town, is Paul Alabaster, a billionaire shipping magnate. Rumors of corruption circulate, but no one dares dig too deep.

The ACLU wrote, “The fundamental issue is that the government has lost a sense of proportion in enforcing our national security laws, and that should be of enormous concern to us all.”</p><p>In his new book, Rosen graphs Scalia’s towering intellect, wit, and literary skills—an unlikely force that illumined the staid, often ill-lit corridors of the Supreme Court. Championing originalism—the idea that the Constitution and statutes should be interpreted according to the original meaning these texts carried when they were enacted, without being expanded or twisted by activist judges—Scalia changed forever the way the law is crafted in Congress, argued before the bench, and adjudicated by our courts. The impact on American society was revolutionary.</p><p>Drawing on his own lunches and correspondence with Scalia, interviews with justices and judges, family members, priests, poker buddies, and hunting companions, Rosen makes Scalia—and the law—come alive.</p><p>Which is a revolutionary thing it itself, and needed more than ever.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CrdlEnJyL._SL1500_.jpg

Bill Brennan spoke of the Court’s entwined functions, of “how arduous and long is the process of developing the sensitivity to constitutional adjudication that defines the role.” Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who served from 1930 to 1941, estimated it takes “about three years” to integrate fully into the Court’s workload and rhythms, public and private; Justice Robert Jackson, one of Scalia’s stylistic heroes, thought it nearer to five.</p><p>Even Chief Justice Rehnquist, first in his class at Stanford law and a senior Justice Department official at the time of his appointment to the Court, later confessed that his first days there, in January 1972, made for an “almost mind-boggling” experience: “Here we were deciding things of great import,” he thought. “Who am I to be doing this?”</p><p>Antonin Scalia harbored such concerns—but never aired them. Asked during his tenure on the Court of Appeals if anything had surprised him when he first donned a judge’s robes, in 1982, Scalia replied: “No. I’ve been surprised at how little I’ve been surprised.”</p><blockquote>It was quite as I expected. . . . I came to it from teaching. I think it’s a much easier transition from teaching than from anywhere else because the job is essentially a contemplative job. . . . We have very little to do with the practicing bar except when they argue their cases in front of us. The rest of our time is spent reading their briefs and conferring with the other judges about the cases and writing opinions in the cases. So it’s very much a scholarly kind of an occupation.</blockquote><p>Scalia likewise found the nature of his new work identical: “It’s the same job as being an appellate judge on a lower court: You read the briefs. You hear the argument. You write the opinion.” 2</p><p>Scalia’s first term at the Court <em>did </em>hold surprises, however, and with them: disappointment.</p><p>But like a good lawyer, he worked around it.</p><p>On the Court of Appeals, where three-judge panels handled most cases, Scalia had found the intimacy appealing. He and the other appellate judges would casually drop by each other’s chambers to talk cases, <em>kibitz</em>, trade jokes. At the Court, Scalia encountered a much different scene.</p><p>“It’s great work,” the new justice told a friend, “but it’s sometimes like being locked up in a vault.” Where Scalia, the first former law professor to join the Court in nearly half a century, loved to mix it up, to debate, to persuade and be persuaded—<em>a clerk likened him to a chess master disappointed to find only ten challengers waiting at the park to take him on</em>—he found the justices’ conferences devoid of intellectual give-and-take.</p><p>Chief Justice Rehnquist, who had chafed at the lengthy opening remarks at conferences by his predecessor, Warren Burger, moved briskly through the agenda in the Conference Room. It <em>bothered </em>him when justices debated cases. “I have no power of contempt, no power of any sort, and if they disagree and get very excited and want to start talking back and forth,” the chief said in his first television interview after assuming his duties, “there is nothing in the world that can stop them except kind of a frown.”</p><p>In his zeal to quash such eruptions, Rehnquist struck Scalia as “something of a martinet.” “Conference is really a misnomer,” Scalia would say. “It isn’t an attempt to persuade one another.”</p><blockquote>It is mostly each justice setting forth his or her views, and the major function of it is not to change other people’s votes, because they come in with their minds made up, but rather, you take notes so that you know the theories that the other justices have of the case. If you are so unfortunate to be assigned the case, you will know how to write it in a way that will get at least four other votes—which is the name of the game, right?</blockquote><p>“I remember the first time he went to Conference,” said Patrick Schiltz, who clerked for Scalia in his final term on the D.C. Circuit and first term on the Court, and later served as chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. “He was very disappointed.”</p><blockquote>He was surprised at how little the justices talked about the merits of the case. . . . They sat down and it was like a roll call where they . . . basically said they were voting to affirm or to reverse. . . . Some of them would give a one- or two-sentence explanation, and it was clear that none of them were interested in debating or discussing with each other the merits of the case or trying to persuade each other. . . . It was, “Let’s get the stuff done; let’s get it done quickly; let’s go home.” That was Rehnquist, and it was often . . . a frustration to the justice.</blockquote><p>“I don’t like that,” Scalia declared before a university audience in 1988. “Maybe it’s just because I’m new. Maybe it’s because I’m an ex-academic. Maybe it’s because I’m right.</p><p>After that first Conference, Scalia appeared at the chambers of the last junior justice, Sandra Day O’Connor, and shut the door behind him. “Is that the way conferences always are?” he asked. “They’re even worse than the D.C. Circuit conferences. I can’t tell you how shocked and disappointed I am. There doesn’t seem to be any room for give-and-take.” <em>That’s the way it is</em>, O’Connor told him. The justices came to Conference well prepared, knew how they wished to vote, and proceeded without much fuss. “She likes Nino very much,” John O’Connor recorded in his diary, “but wonders how others may react as he had come on so strong so soon.”</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CrdlEnJyL._SL1500_.jpg
