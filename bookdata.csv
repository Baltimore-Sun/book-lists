Out of that tapestry comes an epic, poignant portrait of the ambiguities, corruptions, and moral-spiritual aspirations that attend these extraordinary fifty states.</p><p>At its center is Chip Zobel, a nineteen-year-old Marine who, in 1967, marches off to Vietnam with the clear conscience of a boy who believes his country’s story. What he finds there—the blurred lines between defender and enemy—shakes his faith.</p><p>On the other side of the mirror stands May, a fifteen-year-old Vietnamese girl whose father was killed by an American soldier. She flees to the forest and joins a Viet Cong training camp. Three months later, she makes her first kill as a sniper. Bradley writes: “Years afterward, May told me she got no thrill out of shooting the Marine,"" the first of her kills. She explained her motivation: “The Americans broke into my home—Vietnam—and killed my father and mother. I had to stand up for one Vietnam . . . there is nothing more precious than freedom.”</p><p>Bradley’s gaze is both unsparing and deeply human, and the result is an intimate story detailed with factual accounts of the American war in Vietnam.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71alw65Js6L._SL1500_.jpg

She had been sitting there for hours, days really. It was almost time.</p><p>In Washington, President Johnson, Defense Secretary McNamara, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff examined maps and discussed battalions, platoons, munitions, helicopters, airplanes. These logical Westerners were fighting a mechanistic techno war. They had it all figured out. They would deploy ground troops and airpower to search and destroy and produce body count until the crossover point was reached and Ho Chi Minh would throw in the towel. What the American war planners never considered was the effect that a pretty little fifteen-year-old girl determined to save her country, patient enough to spend a week sitting in a tree, could have on the world’s greatest military machine.</p><p>One day, May had noticed an American Marine down by the river. He almost seemed to be taking a walk. May made a mental note of it and showed up the next afternoon at the same time. The tall Marine was there again. He was there the next day, as well, accompanied by a group of other Marines.</p><p>Two weeks later, the Marine walked into the sight of May’s rifle, which was braced on a sturdy tree limb. She slowly pulled the trigger back. Breathing through her nose, May took the shot. As the rifle butt recoiled against her right shoulder, the bullet flew through the leaves, traveled across the river, and struck the Marine directly in the back of his head. Because of the distance, May could not hear if the Marine cried out in pain. But she watched as he fell, and his twenty or so comrades in unison dropped to one knee, raised their rifles, and shot aimlessly in a 360-degree radius at the trees and bushes on their side of the river and those across the river.</p><p>It had taken two weeks of preparation to get off that one bullet. After determining that Marine’s schedule, she had studied the trees on her side of the river and then climbed two of them to locate the best perch. A day later she brought her rifle up. She cut some leaves away for a better view and practiced different ways to brace the rifle. Two days later, the Marine and his men again marched in the same area. She didn’t take a shot, she just sighted them, imagining what she would do when she did. After they left, she had studied the wind current, picked out a tree trunk as a stand-in for a Marine, and took a practice shot. She was proud of her bull’s-eye. The next day she was up in the tree waiting but the Marines did not appear, so she took two practice shots, both on the mark. The next two mornings were long and she waited, but no Marines. Two more practice shots and now she was confident that she had it down. Two more days passed before the group of Marines moved slowly into view.</p><p>The Marine she shot fell to the red earth. The alerted Marines, now each on one knee, had no idea where the shot had come from. Both riv­erbanks were lined with thick bushes about three feet high. The leafy trees on both sides were tall, thick, their lines unbroken. The Marines shot up and all around, but there was no chance they would hit May. They would not have been able to see her unless they were directly under her tree. They couldn’t ford the river there, and they weren’t motivated to do so because they had no idea if the shot came from the bushes or the trees on their side, much less the bushes or trees on the far side. May knew it was a kill by the way they carried his limp corpse away, surrounded by a vigilant honor guard of Marines with rifles ready looking for the invisible sniper.</p><p>Mr. Son and General Giap were correct. May was small. The Marines were big. She was few. They were many. May used stealth, secrecy, surprise. They were noisy, moving in groups, easy to see, and did not employ the arts of war. She seized the initiative; the Marines were passive. May took the shot and hit the target.</p><p>Consider the huge psychological impact that one young woman, only fifteen years old, had on that group of Marines. The bullet came out of nowhere. Nobody saw it coming. They could have fought back if they had encountered troops on the ground. That would have been relatively straightforward and made sense, but on that riverbank, with their commander lying dead on the ground, they were left with an eerie feeling that they were being hunted. They understood that death could ring out from anywhere at any time. They couldn’t explain it. Nor did they talk about it among themselves. But each Marine went to sleep uneasy that night.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>It had taken a tremendous amount of expense, planning, logistics, and support to get those Marines out on that riverbank that day. They were expensively outfitted and had been transported across the largest ocean on earth. In contrast, there were millions of Long-Haired Warriors like May who did not need orders, cost next to nothing, and were distributed throughout the country ready to wreak havoc on America’s best-laid plans. People’s War would defeat the Americans. Yet, the Pentagon Papers later revealed that no president from Truman through Johnson ever held a meeting to discuss People’s War.</p><p>Communists. They were the bogeyman. The hometown newspaper of May’s victim would write that he was killed “fighting the communists.” Officials in Washington referred to “communist leader Ho Chi Minh” and Walter Cronkite began his newscasts with, “communist forces today. . . .” It’s interesting that Americans don’t write, “Capitalist leader George Washington and the Capitalist troops at Valley Forge.” The Valley Forge troops were patriots fighting to get the British out of their hair.</p><p>Young May knew nothing about communists, and when I interviewed her and Mr. Son decades later, they never used the word “communist.” Like the heroes of the American Revolution, the heroes of Vietnam’s uprising were patriots who wanted the invaders out so they could run their own country the way they wanted.</p><p>Years afterward, May told me she got no thrill out of shooting the Marine, the first of her kills. She explained her motivation: “The Americans broke into my home—Vietnam—and killed my father and mother. I had to stand up for one Vietnam. Uncle Ho said it best, ‘There is nothing more precious than freedom.’”</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71alw65Js6L._SL1500_.jpg
