I think he’s the best prose writer working now—I really do.”<br /> <strong>—Bret Easton Ellis</strong><br /> <br /> “A blistering triumph, this novel showcases Wagner's rare and unforgettable voice.”<br /> <strong>—<em>Booklist</em>, (starred review)</strong><br /> <br /> “Marked by Wagner’s inimitable wit, spot-on caricatures, and chatty discursive style, this is on par with his best.”<br /> <strong><em>—Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><h5 style=""padding-bottom: 5px;border-bottom: 1px solid #000;margin-top: 25px;margin-bottom: 16px"">An Excerpt from <em>Amputation</em></h5> <p>The comedian didn’t know if he was crushed or just pinned.</p><p>The tree was wet.</p><p>It was a tall pine and he knew that meant its roots went horizontal, making it prone to toppling; a useless piece of trivia that did him no good just now.</p><p>What <em>would </em>do him any good?</p><p>The winds were otherworldly—might they lift this thing? <em>Then </em>what?—he was unable to move.</p><p><em>How am I not dead?</em></p><p>He could move his arms at the elbows, painfully jostling them into shrugged-up surrender like a beaten-down cormorant making a futile pass at drying its wings. There were fires on the mountain and in patches nearby, yet he barely felt the heat.</p><p><em>No, the flames will not consume me</em>. <em>This I know. This, I feel.</em></p><p>Sometimes there came prolonged fury—crazed battalions of embers scattered and divebombed, hot ash scouts reconnoitered, a damned murmuration of lost soul starlings, a violent, epileptic shimmering here, there, everywhere—and he heard himself shout in awkward, perverse jubilation like the tween supernerd he once was while white knuckling a roller coaster’s steely bar.</p><p>He was able to slowly wrap his arms around the tree, dark with water and retardant, ‘That’s a good thing,’ he said aloud. Then, to himself, ‘<em>Not paralyzed</em>.’</p><p>A defunct optimist, smote by the Immensity . . .</p><p>He thought of <em>The Lord of the Rings, </em>its pages made from trees such as this. The books that saved him after the jet crash deaths of his beloved father and brothers. He closed his eyes and willed Treebeard to lift him in its arms, just as it had the hobbits Merry and Pippin.</p><p><em>Evie will be worried I haven’t called . . . </em></p><p>His beautiful bride of forty-two years.</p><p>How many times had he spoken of the night they first met?</p><p>He’d rhapsodized over it during <em>Late Show </em>audience warm-ups, mythologized the moment during interviews with obsequious starstruck priests, and shared his precious memories with devout Paley Center grovelers who gathered to honor him. At the time he met his wife-to-be, the comedian was still (sort of) with his girlfriend Anne, who was pressing to get hitched. She told him, ‘Fish or cut bait, Stephen.’ He went back home to mull it over (or maybe cut bait). Charleston was his Shire, the fruitful land that gave him strength and power. When he told his mother about his dilemma, she asked if he loved Anne. He said that he did. ‘Do you want to marry her?’ He said he didn’t know. ‘Well,’ said Mom, ‘that isn’t good enough.’ So he cleared his head at the Spoleto festival that night and watched some opera—music by Philip Glass, with poems by Allen Ginsberg. After the <em>divertissement</em>, he went to a party and saw Evie across a room and storybook-thought, ‘That’s who I’m going to marry.’</p><p>The fateful meeting was a grab bag of epiphanies and small ecstasies—they talked for hours before realizing they knew each other when they were kids. (‘God was chasing me all along,’ he told Diane Sawyer on <em>Sixty Minutes</em>, ‘in the form of Evie.’) As their conversation meandered, Stephen spoke of a poet from Charleston whose work he was having trouble finding when suddenly a voice behind them shouted, ‘That poet is my father!’ Rehashing the couple’s origin story to enthralled acolytes and supersmart groupies, the comedian always said, ‘That was the <em>sign</em>. You see, the poet’s son sneezed a blessing upon the specialness of meeting Evie’—then thoughtfully helped listeners to understand the term. ‘It’s from the Robert Fagles translation of the Nausicaa chapter in <em>The Odyssey</em>, which hearkens to an old superstition: When someone sneezes during the telling of a fantastical story, it’s a blessing and means the story must be true.’</p><p>When the heinous hothead winds receded, he spoke out loud again, reciting a line from his favorite E. E. Cummings—<em>i thank You God for most this amazing day: for the leaping greenly spirits of trees</em>—then cursed himself for losing the thread because he couldn’t remember what came next. Was pain scrambling his memory? Was he feeling pain? He wasn’t even sure. There was <em>some </em>. . . but really more of a numbness, a primordial ache. The observation was replaced by an inkling, one that he needed to push away pronto:</p><p><em>The pain will come. And when it does, it will be intolerable. </em></p><p>He glid to an old favorite, Matthew 6:27, as a reset. He mustered the energy to declaim, ‘Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers . . . <em>wildfires!</em>’— pleased with his improvisation—‘that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?’</p><p>He began another recitation—Thompson’s <em>The Hound of Heaven </em>(‘What a sight I must be!’ thought Stephen, watching himself from above like a rescue drone. ‘It’s like bad Beckett.’)—that stunning ode to God’s fierce, love-soaked pursuit of errant, fleeing souls. As if to prove to himself and the cosmos that he was of profoundly sound mind, if not of body, he didn’t stop until the final, 182nd line:</p><block><p>‘Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest,</p><p>I am He Whom thou seekest!</p><p>Thou dravest love from thee, who dravest Me.’</p></block><p>Ha! <em>Hahaha</em>—</p><p><em>See? Ya still got it, baby </em>. . .</p><p>He’d always had the knack to vomit up a long poem.</p><p>But each time he gave in to the flourish, something gnawed, because Stephen knew it was just a revolting party trick (like Cavett and his self-beloved anagrams), a braggadocio deceit, a peacock’s artifice— nothing more than a tool of seduction honed on college girls back in the day. Still, there he’d find himself, again and again, bewitched by his own bullshit, preening his Lay Theologian Laureate shtick at ecumenical conferences, strutting his stuff while accepting the Laetare Medal at the University of Notre Dame. He even marathon-versified with Fallon, Conan, Whoopi, and Chris Rock when they pilgrimaged to Italy to meet ‘Papa’ Francis. On the streets of Rome or <em>à table </em>in La Pergola, he couldn’t help burning through the Pilgrim’s Prayer—or Aquinas—or Yeats—for the wow factor. For the <em>fix. </em>Like jumping out of a cake nude but instead of his tits, he knocked em dead with his brain.</p><p>All was vanity . . . the fundamental sin.</p><p>Now, he was cornered; he couldn’t dravest away, let alone stand up.</p><p>The winds kicked and slapped, their fiendish firefly parasites swarming in superheated abandon. He howled and winced and thought of Evie and their kids and finally wept. The crying caused pain. With the outburst came fear and release.</p><p>The only poem still standing was a prayer he dare not give voice: <em>Yes, Father. Let God’s love descend upon me like holy embers.</em></p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618vMqm-EYL._SL1500_.jpg
