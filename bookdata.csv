The Marvel Universe: Origin Stories: Designed by Dmitry Samarov,Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,"Bruce Wagner, designed by Dmitry Samarov",Paperback,Arcade,"November 4, 2025",978-1648211843,"<p>Dmitry Samarov is an extraordinary painter and exceptional author who came to the States from Russia in 1978. Currently, he lives in Chicago. A few years back, when he reviewed my novel <em>Roar</em>, we struck up an acquaintance, and when the protean Samarov sent me some books he’d written and published himself (<em>Old Style</em>, <em>Paint By Numbers</em>, <em>Hack</em>), my mouth dropped—I simply wasn’t expecting a slew of the most beautiful volumes I’d ever seen in my life. Sometime later, he emailed me with the luminously idiosyncratic notion of illustrating my canceled (censored) novel <em>The Marvel Universe</em>; I was touched and honored. My fearless publisher Arcade was reissuing my back catalogue and had already put out <em>Marvel</em>, with an introduction by Tony Lyons, the premier, iconic spearhead of free speech in America and a tireless supporter of writers. After seeing Samarov’s work, Tony and my editor, Stephan Zguta, decided to publish a second volume of <em>Marvel</em>, with Samarov’s illustrations—sixty Sumi ink paintings, along with cover art and design. Samarov’s <em>Marvel</em> has become a collector’s item, and you too can hold it in your hands; I should add that I would not directly profit from such an acquisition; when <em>Marvel </em>was cancelled, I released it into the public domain. Blessings upon fearless readers, and upon Samarov the Great!</p>",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hWvSI6gyh7vEpLSUAOfO4jAmUhFyqZQo/view?usp=sharing

Aside from the stacks of tickets displayed behind the counter, it housed a dozen industrial-sized vending machines. Throngs of poor people clustered at the myriad grimy counters, scratching away.</p></p><h5 style=""padding-bottom: 5px;border-bottom: 1px solid #000;margin-top: 25px;margin-bottom: 16px"">An Excerpt from <em>The Marvel Universe</em></h5><p>After buying the pills and treating himself to a hundred-dollar lunch at the downtown Pacific Dining Car, he still had forty-five hundred in twenties left from the wad Garry advanced him. He immediately bought three $20 Monopoly scratchers, two of which were losers. When he scratched the last, instead of a number it said GO—an instant $200 payback. He took it as an omen to play his favorite, a $20 game called Big Win. On the left of the ticket were eight “lucky numbers”—and 25 on the right that were their potential matches. All 25 <img src=""media/image1.jpeg"" alt=""A black and white drawing of a pharmacy"" style=""float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;"">numbers had a different “win” amount. (The lottery geniuses only printed <em>four </em>Big Win tickets—each returned $5 million—but the odds scratching a big boy were three-million-to-one.) Above the two groups of “lucky” and potential “matching” numbers was a little WIN ALL BONUS window—if you scratched it and the words BIG WIN were underneath, you won every single prize that was listed beneath each of the 25 numbers on the right side of the ticket. He’d played the game hundreds of times and never scratched off a BIG WIN, and never expected to. The probability was so unlikely that Bud never focused on it, often retrieving a losing ticket from the trash because he’d forgotten to give the BIG WIN window a cursory, futile scratch.</p><p>Bud bought two tickets and lost. Then another two and lost.</p><p>Then another two and lost.</p><p>In his experience, it was unusual to lose six times in a row. Usually with six bets you’d at least win even money on <em>one</em>; the odds were in your favor, “Gambler’s Fallacy” be damned. In a rare fit of prudence, Bud decided to fold his cards and leave. But on the way out, he put $40 in a vending machine and bought a $30 ticket called $10,000,000 Bankroll—plus a ten-dollar called Precious Diamonds.</p><p>In another fit of prudence, he didn’t bother scratching the tickets on the hood of his car but drove off instead.</p><p>A few blocks later, he pulled over.</p><p>Precious Diamonds was a loser—but Bankroll returned $500. Oh, that was <em>very </em>good.</p><p>The State Lottery website said the odds of a $500 win on that particular scratcher were 300-to-1.</p><p>He had an ironclad rule: whenever he won $100 or more on a single scratcher, he’d stop playing for the day. He was already in violation yet had profited by $500.</p><p>Sometimes it paid to go outside of the law.</p><p>He decided to cash the ticket then see how he felt. Usually, only the bigger grocery stores had enough cash on hand to pay out a $500 win. He went to a Pavilions in West Hollywood. They were used to big winners and didn’t bat an eye. It was like visiting the cashier of a Vegas casino.</p><p>Now he had close to 5K in his pocket—after the pills and the Dining Car, scratchers had made him whole.</p><p>He decided he’d buy a few more Big Wins and call it a day.</p><p>But not at Pavilions—the vibe didn’t feel right. He’d find an obscure gas station. Maybe even fill up the tank while he was at it. Two birds. He always seemed to have better luck when he filled up the tank.</p><p>He found a shitty Sinclair station way down on Olympic and bought two Big Wins and scratched the window on both. He was stunned. Underneath one of the little portals, it said . . .</p><p></p><p style=""text-align:center;"">BIG WIN</p><p></p><p>He couldn’t believe what his eyes were telling him, but there it was:</p><p><em>He had won all 25 “matching” numbers.</em></p><p>Bud’s heart began to hammer.</p><p>He was shaking so much that he didn’t scratch off any of the twenty-five individual dollar-amounts to see what he had won. Instead, he scratched the bar code at the bottom and walked over to scan the ticket at the machine. He knew a “Big Win” didn’t necessarily mean you’d won five million. It could be <em>one </em>million—or <em>two</em>.</p><p>Whatever it was, it had to be BIG.</p><p>He stood at the scanner, in a stinksweat—how much was he looking at? Bud downscaled expectations, thinking, <em>At the very least, it’s a hundred thou. </em>In lightning <img src=""media/image2.jpeg"" alt=""A close-up of a black and white drawing"" style=""float:left; margin:0 1em 1em 0;"">speed, he saw himself at the Lottery Office, smiling for the camera like a cretin, holding one of those six-foot-long checks. He rehearsed what he’d do with five million . . . He took a deep breath and prepared to slide the bar code under the scanner. Bud realized that he hadn’t written his name on the back, which you were supposed to do if you won more than $500. He hoped he wouldn’t pass out when he saw the amount confirmed onscreen. Whoever came to his aid might steal the ticket; if that happened, he hoped the security cameras were working.</p><p>The machine beeped, then read</p><p></p><p style=""text-align:center;"">You’re a Winner!</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">$100</p>",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hWvSI6gyh7vEpLSUAOfO4jAmUhFyqZQo/view?usp=sharing
