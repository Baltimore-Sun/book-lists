We Survived the Night,Recommended Books,,Julian Brave NoiseCat,Hardcover,Knopf,"October 14, 2025",978-0593320785,"<p>Julian Brave NoiseCat’s childhood was rich with culture and contradictions. When his Secwépemc and St’at’imc father, an artist haunted by a turbulent past, abandoned the family, NoiseCat and his non-Native mother were embraced by the urban Native community in Oakland, California, as well as by family on the Canim Lake Indian Reserve in British Columbia. In his father’s absence, NoiseCat immersed himself in Native history and culture to understand the man he seldom saw—his past, his story, where he came from—and, by extension, himself.</p><p>Years later, NoiseCat sets out across the continent to correct the erasure, invisibility, and misconceptions surrounding the First Peoples of this land as he develops his voice as a storyteller and artist. Told in the style of a ""Coyote Story,"" a legend about the trickster forefather of NoiseCat’s people who was revered for his wit and mocked for his tendency to self-destruct, <em>We Survived the Night</em> brings a traditional art form nearly annihilated by colonization back to life on the page. Through a dazzling blend of history and mythology, memoir and reportage, NoiseCat unravels old stories and braids together new ones.</p><p>Drawing from five years of on-the-ground reporting, <em>We Survived the Night</em> paints a profound and unforgettable portrait of contemporary Indigenous life, alongside an intimate and deeply powerful reckoning between a father and a son. A soulful, formally daring, and indelible work from an important new voice.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819+N+I5y1L._SL1500_.jpg,,,,,,,,,

Diving in to protect Butina from the onslaught of the government’s case, the Twitterverse accused Carry of treason. Partners demanded he drop the case. Friends and family worried that he was ruining his career before it had even started. Yet this was only the beginning of a case that would transform Carry’s life and his understanding of American society.</p><p>A Russian nesting doll of two-time con men, charming billionaires, sniping media figures, CIA back channels, and clandestine operatives, <em>In Wolf’s Clothing: My Story Representing Maria Butina, the Most Famous Woman in Moscow</em> is the first-person account of how a young attorney is thrust into the public eye to defend a woman accused of attacking the country he loves.

Whistleblower is a word that once reflected the magnificently sane idea of checks and balances; when government or corporations overstep their legal and moral bounds, an insider stands up like Howard Beale, shouting from the television that they’re mad as hell and not going to take this anymore—<em>and here’s why</em>. But now, that very word has been smeared by the very entities being flushed from their rat holes: “whistleblower” is predictably being culturally tilted by corporate PR toward the space occupied by so-called conspiracy theorists, malcontents, and attention whores. Good luck with that.</p><p><em>Exposed</em> recounts molecular biologist Becky McClain raising urgent alarms about biosafety lapses at her biotech lab at Pfizer—warnings met by intimidation, and ultimately, devastating illness after a workplace exposure changed McClain’s life forever. In April 2010, she won a federal court whistleblower trial against Pfizer, which centered on free speech rights related to public health.</p><p>Of <em>Exposed</em>, world-renowned criminologist and author, Gavin de Becker (<em>Gift of Fear</em>), wrote: “McClain’s effective writing and credibility made her Pfizer’s worst nightmare—and at the same time, one of our best truthtellers.”</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CfvRvI+0L._SL1500_.jpg,,,,,,,,,

McClain</strong>, a retired 23-year career biotech worker and research scientist, is known as the first successful biotech whistleblower who spoke and reported on biolab safety issues of public concern. On April 1, 2010, McClain won a federal court whistleblower trial against Pfizer, Inc., which centered on free speech rights concerning biosafety and public health.</p><p>“Becky McClain delivers an exposé we can’t ignore. Her effective writing and her credibility make her Pfizer’s worst nightmare–and at the same time, one of our best truthtellers.”<br /> <strong>–Gavin de Becker, bestselling author of <em>The Gift of Fear<br /> <br /> </em></strong>“A scientist gets infected with an unknown virus in her lab and her corporate employer tries to silence her. Sounds like a Hollywood script, except it's all too real. <em>Exposed</em> offers an insider's view of how America’s biolabs operate and the risks they pose. It’s a cautionary tale in an age of pandemics.”<br /> <strong>–Jeremy Gruber, JD, former President of the Council for Responsible Genetics and author of<em> Biotechnology in our Lives</em>, <em>Genetic Explanations: Sense and Nonsense</em>, and <em>The GMO Deception</em></strong><br /> <br /></p><h5 style=""padding-bottom: 5px;border-bottom: 1px solid #000;margin-top: 25px;margin-bottom: 16px"">An Excerpt from <em>Exposed</em></h5><p>More than half of the fifty-two safety questions were answered with the same vague phrase, that “management would meet to discuss these issues.” There were no timelines given to meet, consider, or report back to the staff regarding our safety concerns. And unfortunately, there never would be. Pfizer management didn’t care.</p><p>It was soon after this when we first started to become ill in the lab. It was September 2002. Pittle sat in the far corner of lab B313 with his hands working inside the biocontainment hood as he added apoptosis agents to plates of embryonic stem cells for a research study. I stood at my workbench, harvesting cells for a flow cytometry analysis, when we both began to notice an odd and peculiar odor within the lab. As we continued to work, the pungent odor, having a bizarre oily smell and chalky taste, became stronger and overbearing.</p><p>“Daryl, I think the odor is making me sick,” I said as my stomach turned queasy, and my throat and nasal passages felt as if they were covered with a chalky substance.</p><p>“Me too. Whatever it is, it’s noxious! I’m nauseous and have a hammer of a headache,” Pittle said across the room, still working inside the biosafety hood.</p><p>We tried to locate the source. But the invisible noxious odor had filled the room, making it difficult to pinpoint its origin. It soon overwhelmed us.</p><p>“What the hell is that stuff?” Pittle quickly placed the culture dishes into the incubator and switched off the fan on the biosafety hood. “I feel like shit,” he said, looking pale. He closed the B313 lab door behind us as we evacuated the lab.</p><p>I contacted Pfizer’s Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) staff to see if anyone could come to the lab to assist us. Only answering machines picked up. With no other option, I called Pfizer’s emergency services. Soon, the Pfizer Fire Department was at our door. The firemen were unable to locate the source of the noxious odor, either. We noticed, however, that the foul fumes were dissipating.</p><p>“Something must have passed through Pfizer’s internal exhaust and into the lab,” I said to Pittle and the fire chief, a blacked-haired, burly man, a head shorter than Pittle.</p><p>After returning home later that day, my initial symptoms from the noxious lab exposure worsened. It felt like I had the flu. My gut twisted with cramps, and I was nauseous for most of the night. At work the next morning, Pittle told me he had been ill too. He had arrived late that morning and looked as tired and peaked as I felt. “I was sick as a dog all night long,” he said. “I vomited for at least eight hours and didn’t get much sleep.”</p><p>The realization that both of us had become very ill that evening from the exposure concerned us. Together, that morning, we reported to the Pfizer Health Clinic to discuss the incident with Pfizer’s on-site doctor and to be evaluated. The next day, however, we felt no lingering symptoms and our concerns over the exposure diminished.</p><p>But a week later, the same noxious odor suddenly returned. This time, we noticed it immediately after Daryl had turned on the fan to the biocontainment</p><p>hood. It now was obvious: the sickening smell was coming from the exhaust portal at the top of the hood and filling the room.</p><p>“This is very odd,” Pittle said to me with a puzzled look. “The air exhausted into the room from the hood should be clean and free of contaminants since it’s filtered through a HEPA filter.”</p><p>I shared his concern. Neither of us had ever experienced or heard of this type of problem from a biocontainment laminar-flow hood. This time, as we started to develop headaches and nausea from the exposure, we knew to evacuate the lab sooner rather than later. An hour later, the odor had dissipated, and we returned to the lab to work.</p><p>The next day, a laminar-flow hood specialist from a contracting company was called in.</p><p>“I see the problem. It’s a biological spill,” the specialist said with a deep voice. “It seeped through the grill.” He pointed to a dried puddle of cell media hidden underneath the working platform of the biocontainment hood. “I have seen this before,” he told me. “If someone leaves a spill, it can contaminate the area and make the hood smell bad.”</p><p>It concerned me that someone using the biocontainment hood had spilled liquid culture media, used to grow cultured cells, bacteria, or virus, and then had not cleaned and disinfected the hood per protocol. Other than Daryl Pittle, only two other people had used the hood in B313 during the previous three months. Both worked in virology, and both worked with genetically engineered viruses. Todd Crayton, who had recently left a genetically engineered virus in our break area, was one of them.</p><p>“Ugh, this is <em>really </em>bad,” the specialist said as he coughed and held his hand over his nose and mouth. He had opened the top of the biocontainment hood to access the HEPA filter, and the harmful fumes overwhelmed him. He soon reported that whatever the contamination was, it had turned the HEPA filter from pristine white to a solid black. The mystery agent had obviously impregnated the filter and was now captured inside it.</p><p>The specialist removed the contaminated HEPA filter from the hood and wrapped it securely in layers of plastic to prevent further exposure. Incredibly, Pfizer EHS personnel took the contaminated HEPA filter and placed it in the hallway directly next to our break area. Tracy Nellis, our EHS representative, told us that the filter would be stored there until they decided what to do with it. I just shook my head at that point, steering clear of the contaminated item sitting in the hallway while wondering what accident might befall us all next.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CfvRvI+0L._SL1500_.jpg,,,,,,,,,
