Wisdom Takes Work: Learn. Apply. Repeat. (The Stoic Virtues Series),Recommended Books,,Ryan Holiday,Hardcover,Portfolio,"October 21, 2025",978-0593191736,"<p><strong>In this much-anticipated final installment in the <em>Stoic Virtues</em> series, Ryan Holiday makes the case for the virtue on which all other virtues depend.</strong><br /> <br /> Of all the stoic virtues - courage, discipline, justice, and wisdom - wisdom is the most elusive. This is especially apparent in an age where reaction and idle chatter are rewarded, and restraint and thoughtfulness are unfashionable. The great statesman and philosophers of the past would not be fooled, as we are, by headlines or appearances or the primal pull of tribalism. They knew too much of history, of their own flaws, of the need for collaboration to do any of that. That's wisdom - and we need it more than ever.</p><p>Wisdom is Ryan Holiday's guiding principle, and <em>Wisdom Takes Work</em> is the culmination of all his work. Drawing on fascinating stories of the ancient and modern figures alike, Holiday shows how to cultivate wisdom through reading, self-education, and experience. Through the lives of Montaigne, Seneca, Joan Didion, Abraham Lincoln, and others, Holiday teaches us how to listen more than we talk, to think with nuance, to ruthlessly question our own beliefs, and to develop a method of self-education. He argues convincingly for the necessity of mental struggle and warns against taking shortcuts that deprive us of real knowledge. And he shows us how dangerous power and intelligence can be without the tempering influence of wisdom.</p><p>An absence of curiosity and prudence is a catastrophe for all of us, argues Ryan Holiday. This incredibly timely book both diagnoses the greatest problem of our current moment and offers solutions for the way forward. Wisdom is work - but it's worth it.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812gFWxrURL._SL1500_.jpg,,,,,,,,,
The Christmas Stranger,Recommended Books,,Richard Paul Evans,Hardcover,Gallery Books,"November 4, 2025",978-1668014905,"<p><strong>From the bestselling author of the Christmas classic <em>The Christmas Box</em> and the movie <em>The Noel Diary </em>comes a powerful and thought-provoking holiday story about love, loss, and the mysterious workings of heaven.</strong><br /> <br /> Three years after losing his family in a Christmas Eve accident, grief-stricken Paul Wanlass hasn’t just given up on Christmas, he’s given up on life. He can’t imagine anything to keep him here—not his work as a computer repairman, not the residents in his Salt Lake City neighborhood, and certainly not the idea of connecting with someone new. When a stranger knocks on his door, claiming to be picking up a laptop, Paul allows him in—but discovers the man has a very different mission in mind. When the stranger shows up again, Paul challenges him to give him just one reason to live. The stranger agrees to the challenge but warns Paul not to expect a path he would have guessed or chosen.</p><p>As the stranger promised, Paul’s life takes a wild and fateful turn. A robbery connects him with a woman who has also lost the love of her life, and, in a seemingly unrelated incident, Paul rescues a young boy from bullying, only to find the boy needs a different kind of rescue. The twists leave Paul wondering what these people have in common, and why they were brought together. Who—or what—really is this Christmas stranger, and how will Paul find meaning once again?</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QKxGox6mL._SL1500_.jpg,,,,,,,,,
Diary of Small Discontents: New & Selected Poems 1974–2024,Recommended Books,,John Yau,Paperback,Omnidawn,"October 6, 2025",978-1632431752,"<p><strong>A collection of poetry showcasing the diversity of subjects and forms in Yau’s writing.</strong><br /> <br /> This collection brings together work from half a century of writing by John Yau. Preoccupied with forms and musical structures, Yau’s work includes sestinas, sonnets, pantoums, and lists, as well as invented forms. Employing both strict and open-ended frameworks, Yau creates multi-faceted poems that can shift abruptly from humor to outrage and consider topics including Chinese American identity, school shootings, invented countries, and haunted memories. Some poems are grounded in an autobiographical voice, while others take on the voices of other characters, including contemporary artists and a fictional Chinese private eye.</p><p>Spanning the vast diversity of Yau’s forms and subjects, the poems in <em>Diary of Small Discontents</em> add up to an unapologetically original collection.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-dqgeGZfL._SL1500_.jpg,,,,,,,,,

Through setbacks from failing college to heat stroke during Marine boot camp, he refused to surrender.</p><p>His unconventional healing path included living in a 1,000-year-old Dominican monastery in France, building a multi-million-dollar construction business from scratch, raising six sons, and confronting trauma through intensive therapy—including a harrowing suicide attempt that became his turning point.</p><p>LaVé's candid exploration of childhood sexual trauma and mental health struggles offers hope to anyone battling shame. His journey from broken child to successful entrepreneur and Senate candidate proves healing is possible and ordinary Americans can make extraordinary differences.</p><p>Culminating in a face-to-face confrontation with political establishment that inspired his Senate run, this raw, inspiring memoir will resonate with anyone that believes character matters more than credentials and sometimes the most unlikely candidates are exactly what democracy needs.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nh8rMhcgL._SL1500_.jpg,,,,,,,,,
Unscripted,Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,Cheryl Hines,Hardcover,Skyhorse Publishing,"November 11, 2025",978-1510783737,"<p>Not even Cheryl Hines, a rising star in Los Angeles’ legendary improvisational comedy company The Groudlings (before she got her own one on the Hollywood Walk of Fame), could have done justice to the narrative of her own life—but her new memoir, <em>Unscripted</em>, certainly does. Best known for her generation-long portrayal of Larry David’s wife on HBO's <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>, her story spans her beginnings in a small Florida town, bartending in LA (where she audits improv classes), working as Rob Reiner’s personal assistant, then gets <em>Curb</em>ed—and her romance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr before and after he decides to run for president. With biting wit that’s as brutally poignant as it is mordant, Cheryl reveals the challenges and joys of a blended family with her husband, the activist lawyer who became an enemy of Big Pharma and was ultimately appointed Secretary of the Health and Human Services. She too is a lifelong education activist and a tireless drummer for United Cerebral Palsy, inspired by her late nephew Michael who had the disease. If you bought this book to read about her time with Larry David, fine, but you won’t believe what’s coming—the fearlessness, good humor, and WTF aspects of her journey are absolutely inspiring. The off-color joke she’s forced to repeat to the hard-of-hearing Ethel Kennedy at a birthday party in Hyannis Port—Cheryl’s the virgin patsy in a long-running set-up gag by the Kennedy siblings—is worth the price of admission.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71H5u9OWQTL._SL1500_.jpg,,,,,,,,,

Kennedy Jr.</p><h5 style=""padding-bottom: 5px;border-bottom: 1px solid #000;margin-top: 25px;margin-bottom: 16px"">An Excerpt from <em>Unscripted</em></h5><p>The Groundlings could be a competitive place because there were always scouts for sketch shows in attendance. Everyone wanted to stand out. You have to trust that when you’re up there performing, your scene partner is not going to sabotage you just to make themselves look good. That can happen, but for us it was a place where we would know that, if someone was coming to look at a certain person, even though you might feel envious, you’re still excited for that person and you want them to stand out and be great. You want them to get that agent or that audition or that role, so there has to be mutual trust.</p><p>The people I was performing with were rock solid. They would always make me look good, and I believed they wanted the best for me. I felt the same about them. It was exciting because you would watch people being flown to New York to audition for SNL, see them get a great agent or book a job on a sitcom. Even when it didn’t have to do with me, I’d think, “Oh, I’m in the mix for something and if I keep working hard, stay focused, and keep on this path, I know it’s going to lead me somewhere good.”</p><p>By then, I had found my way back to myself. I had a good sense of who I was and had the chance to build back my self-esteem. I was with people I trusted.</p><p>It was an exhilarating time. The show attracted all kinds of celebrities and influential people: Vince Vaughn, John Kennedy Jr., Christopher Guest. At the time, I was working for Rob Reiner, and he and his wife Michele would come to the shows, which I found incredibly supportive. I was witnessing other Groundlings like Will Ferrell, Cheri Oteri, Chris Kattan, and Chris Parnell skyrocket. Lisa Kudrow was on <em>Friends</em> and Mindy Sterling was in <em>Austin Powers</em>.</p><p>I felt that I was close to something, but not quite there. I kept getting called back for the sketch show, <em>Mad TV</em>, but they didn’t offer me the part. Eventually, I had to quit working for the Reiners. It was too hard to keep taking time off for auditions and callbacks.</p><p>I started to book small roles on sitcoms. I even got a few lines on <em>Friends</em>! It was great, but I wasn’t making enough to pay my rent. As the weeks went by, I started to become more and more desperate for a way to earn money to pay my bills. Becky was starting to worry about me. She knew I was running on fumes. She called.</p><p>“Hey, I sent you my ATM card so you can withdraw some cash. You’ve got to hang in there, Cher,” she said reassuringly.</p><p>“What? Rebecca! You didn’t have to do that,” I told her.</p><p>“I know you’re dying out there. Check your mail. It should be there,” she said.</p><p>“Oh my god, thank you. I can’t believe you did that.”</p><p>And there it was. An envelope postmarked Orlando, Florida, with Becky’s ATM card. I ran to the closest bank. I inserted the card, typed in the PIN, and requested $40. <em>Insufficient Funds. </em>Hmmm, I guess I was asking for too much. I requested $20. <em>Insufficient Funds</em>. I laughed so hard it annoyed the people waiting behind me. That’s my sister! She’d give me the last dollar she had—if she had one. I just imagined her going through the trouble of going to the post office and mailing me that card. It didn’t matter that she had no money in her account, the gesture alone made me feel so loved. I called her back.</p><p>“Hey, I tried your card, but I couldn’t get any money out,” I told her.</p><p>We laughed for a long time.</p><p>“Why would you send me a card if you didn’t have any money in your account?”</p><p>“Well, it’s always a crapshoot. Try it again next week on Friday. I might have some money by then,” she said.</p><p>I sent the card back to her. I wasn’t going to take her last dollar, but man, did I love her pluck.</p><p>I was barely scraping by and was looking for ways to stay inspired to keep me focused. I loved watching stand up, but I didn’t have enough money to actually go to a club, so one Saturday night I called The Improv.</p><p>“Listen, I can’t afford to pay the door charge, but I can scrape together enough for the two-drink minimum if you’ll just let me in,” I said.</p><p>The poor guy answering the phone said, “Who are you? What are you talking about?”</p><p>“My friends and I, we just can’t . . . Well, I can’t afford to buy tickets. But we are really good laughers. We’re really loud. We’ll be the best audience you’ve ever seen.”</p><p>“Oh, God. Okay. Just come to the door and ask for Bill. I’ll see what I can do,” he said.</p><p>We went and laughed our asses off as promised. That’s pretty much how I got by for the next few years.</p><p>My roommate Maria turned out to be a lifeline for me. She loaned me money for rent and a little extra to buy food when I couldn’t afford it. To this day, we’re as close as ever. We’ve traveled to Santorini and back and have been to every Hollywood party that would have us. I had found an angel in the City of Angels.</p><p>Maria’s generosity was a temporary Band-Aid at the time but didn’t stop the bleeding. My anxiety about money became more and more intense. I was performing in the Sunday company at the Groundlings, doing my best to write new sketches every week. I was sitting on the news that Larry asked me to play the role of his wife on a new show, but couldn’t move forward until I had an official offer from HBO. My anxiety steadily amplified as the weeks turned into months.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71H5u9OWQTL._SL1500_.jpg,,,,,,,,,
