Her parents like Saul and desperately want the free-spirited Mona to marry. But 34-year-old Saul already has a wife and two children.

After losing her city job in the 1970s fiscal crisis, Mona becomes a freelance news photographer for a radical new tabloid.

Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company,Recommended Books,,Patrick McGee,Hardcover,Scribner,"May 13, 2025",978-1668053379,"<p><strong>For readers of Walter Isaacson’s <em>Steve Jobs</em> and Chris Miller’s <em>Chip War</em>, a riveting look at how Apple helped build China’s dominance in electronics assembly and manufacturing only to find itself trapped in a relationship with an authoritarian state making ever-increasing demands.</strong></p> <p>After struggling to build its products on three continents, Apple was lured by China’s seemingly inexhaustible supply of cheap labor. Soon it was sending thousands of engineers across the Pacific, training millions of workers, and spending hundreds of billions of dollars to create the world’s most sophisticated supply chain. These capabilities enabled Apple to build the 21st century’s most iconic products—in staggering volume and for enormous profit.</p> <p>Without explicitly intending to, Apple built an advanced electronics industry within China, only to discover that its massive investments in technology upgrades had inadvertently given Beijing a power that could be weaponized.</p> <p>In <em>Apple in China</em>, journalist Patrick McGee draws on more than two hundred interviews with former executives and engineers, supplementing their stories with unreported meetings held by Steve Jobs, emails between top executives, and internal memos regarding threats from Chinese competition. The book highlights the unknown characters who were instrumental in Apple’s ascent and who tried to forge a different path, including the Mormon missionary who established the Apple Store in China; the “Gang of Eight” executives tasked with placating Beijing; and an idealistic veteran whose hopes of improving the lives of factory workers were crushed by both Cupertino’s operational demands and Xi Jinping’s war on civil society.</p> <p><em>Apple in China </em>is the sometimes disturbing and always revelatory story of how an outspoken, proud company that once praised “rebels” and “troublemakers”—the company that encouraged us all to “Think Different”—devolved into passively cooperating with a belligerent regime that increasingly controls its fate.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OpYKUnoZL._SL1500_.jpg

The War On Words: 10 Arguments Against Free Speech―And Why They Fail,Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,,Paperback,Greg Lukianoff and Nadine Strossen,"July 1, 2025",978-1949846829,"<p>The heretical novelist William Burroughs once famously said that language is a virus. Some viruses are mild; others are deadly. Greg Lukianoff and Nadine Strossen’s <em>The War On Words: 10 Arguments Against Free Speech—And Why They Fail </em>is an antivenin to the cyclical toxins released in the body politic, the evergreen, seasonal epidemics of speech-killing pathogens that destroy the healthy tissue of free speech. In that sense, the book is as urgent (and evergreen) as the Hippocratic Oath—“First do no harm”—a tricky enterprise when words are adjudged to be the root of the poison. Its subject is nothing less than that timely, timeless, perverse thing – censorship. Censorship is always political and has nothing to do with its natural enemy: Art. Politics will always imprison words and language, but words and language will always stage jail breaks because their only desire is to be free<em>. The War On Words</em> is a simple, necessary volume that provides tools of escape for those who have been wrongly convicted - and the rest of us, who wait to be arrested for crimes of the future. One might call it a tactical book of prayer in these godless times, for which there are often no words. </p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71i8ErWLQYL._SL1500_.jpg
Come Knocking: A Novel,Recommended Books,Book of the Week,Mike Bockoven,Hardcover,Skyhorse Publishing,"July 1, 2025",978-1510783447,"<p><strong>Mike Bockoven</strong> is a horror author living in Nebraska with his wife, Sarah, daughters Emaline and Tessa, and far too many elderly wiener dogs. Find more about his work at <a href=""http://www.mikebockoven.com"">www.mikebockoven.com</a>. </p><p>""Mike Bockoven’s <em>Come Knocking</em> is a chilling, mind-bending triumph that cements his place among the most daring horror novelists of his generation. The novel unfolds through a kaleidoscope of fractured, unforgettable voices—each recounting their experience with a mysterious theatrical event that promised transcendence and delivered terror. Evoking works like Max Brooks's <em>World War Z</em>, <em>Come Knocking</em> assembles a haunting oral history of disaster. Bockoven’s dark wit and existential dread also bring to mind the satirical despair of works like George Saunders’ ""CivilWarLand in Bad Decline"" and the visceral, surreal horror of Clive Barker. It’s a cornucopia of dread and revelation—a daring, unforgettable novel that asks if readers have the courage to attend a mystifying and dangerous performance that may leave them forever changed.""<br><strong>—Scott Kenemore, author of <em>Edge of the Wire</em> and <em>Lake of Darkness</em></strong></p> <p>""Mike Bockoven is back with another clever, heinously violent tale of immersive theater gone horribly wrong.  <em>Come Knocking</em> strikes deep in the readers soul with a hyper-violent psychological tale that examines the lines between theater and reality and what happens when those lines begin to blur.""<br><strong>—Dr. Rebekah McKendry, director, writer, producer</strong></p>  <h5> An Excerpt from <em>Come Knocking</em></h5> <p>Why fifty-six people died on the night of March 14th of last year is as complex a question as the location in which they died. But, to begin this investigation with a simple truth, over the course of five hours 372 people went into the Darnold Center near Los Angeles’s MacArthur Park to see the interactive theater piece known as <em>Come Knocking</em> and 316 came out alive.</p><p>Hidden in that simple fact are more blood-soaked horrors than one investigation should contain—audience members bludgeoned and stabbed, performers shot and strangled, staff found and rescued many hours after the police were called, dozens of people trampled as they sought escape from the hellish maze in which they found themselves. But, before we get there, it’s wise to set the stage, as it were.</p><p><em> Come Knocking</em> is many things, all of them hard to describe. It’s an interactive theater experience, a massive creative and technological undertaking, a show with a powerful and vocal fan base and, technically, a retelling of classic literature through a distinctly American lens. At one time, it was the hottest theater ticket in all of New York—and later Los Angeles, a town known for putting on a show—likely because it was a show that demanded much of its audience and even more of its performers.</p><p>It was also a show that, to hear its performers and organizers talk about it, was nothing short of a blessing that, thanks to time and several monumental misunderstandings, turned into a modern-day curse.</p><p>Opening in New York seven years ago and running for just under five years in the Big Apple, <em > Come Knocking </em > innovated in the theater performance space in a number of noteworthy ways. It was one of the first theater pieces to renovate a multistory building. Some of the technology used is cutting edge now, almost a decade later. But, most importantly, it was an experience that demanded certain things from everyone involved that set it apart.</p><p>Those who were lucky enough to get tickets in New York (the show ran a scant four days a week) were asked to show up at an appointed time, don a mask, and to remain absolutely silent during their time in the Netherworld. While the show mixed elements of Chaucer’s <em> The Canterbury Tales</em> and Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy </em>(with an emphasis on <em > Inferno</em>) into a “narrative about the inevitably of death and one’s own hand in damnation,” visitors were free to walk around the six stories of lavishly decorated and themed sets, explore the surroundings, find their own way through the show and even follow performers. The only official rules were to stay quiet, keep your mask on, and do not, under any circumstances, touch the performers.</p><p>From the official press materials:</p><blockquote > <p><em>A night you will never forget is just the beginning of </em>Come Knocking<em >,an experience that smashes together dance, theater, movement, and special effects into a gory, unspeakable spectacle impossible to ignore. Explore six floors of designed space in an experience that is different for each and every member of the audience. From the depths of hell to the heights of sin, from the basement’s decaying ballroom to the garden of immortality, no two experiences are the same and no soul is safe as the devil gets ready to </em>Come Knocking.</p></blockquote ><p>A robust community of theater fans spread the legend of the New York show, so much so that when Dumb Willie, the production company behind <em>Come Knocking</em>, moved their operation to Los Angeles, it was an immediate sensation. The delayed opening due to many societal fac tors only reinforced the desperate desire for some on the West Coast to experience the show for themselves, and by the time they finally opened, individual tickets were going for thousands of dollars apiece, with no shortage of those willing to pay to descend into the show’s unique madness.</p><p>However, like any controversial piece of art, some saw the show as unwelcome, and others saw it as nothing short of evil. If anything, this is a story about how a small group of people can build a community around negativity and have that negativity curdle into hate and violence.</p><p>Over the course of my investigation, which you will read in the ensuing chapters, I heard from staff, actors, administrators, maintenance workers, and others who worked on the show, all of whom described a “dark feeling” in the months leading up to their “one bad night.” This feeling followed the show, which ran successfully in Los Angeles for three years, until the night of March 14, when rowdy crowds, systemic issues, angry staff, and good old-fashioned poor planning led to one of the bloodiest nights in civilian American history.</p><p>Of course, <em>Come Knocking</em> had no choice but to close, with promises from Dumb Willie Productions that it will never reopen under any circumstances. But it bears repeating that the night in question wasn’t special. The show was sold out like it had been for weeks. It was not the anniversary of the show’s opening or a special promotion that prompted the events of that night. There was no terrorist attack, as was widely speculated by attention-seeking politicians. There are many reasons why the events of March 14 took place, but circumstance is not one of them. As I said earlier, this is a modern story that led to a night soaked in blood and suffering.</p><p>For this book, I was able to speak with dozens of those involved in the production, those who were there that night and, in a coup (if I can say so myself), Clark Cardigan, half of Dumb Willie, who had not spoken publicly about that night since it happened. All the accounts paint a strange picture, one of frayed nerves, ignored warnings, and terror. You will hear many different reasons that this show ended so terribly, but I urge you to make up your own mind.</p><p>Before we “get on with the show,” as it were, there’s something else I’d like to address.</p><p>After my book about the events of FantasticLand became a bestseller, I have been asked to cover any number of stories about mass death, though I was reticent to do so. Some of this was for my own mental health, some of it was that I felt I had lost my voice. While I still yearned, deeply, to connect with subjects and tell their stories, what I had experienced earlier in my career had left me in sort of a malaise. Was I going to write about blood on the streets of America for the rest of my career? Was that an existence I wanted?</p><p>But something about this story feels different. I ask your indulgence for a moment.</p><p>Mass shootings, for example, are a distinctly American phenomenon. You can argue that access to guns is a majority of the problem (it is) but I believe there’s something deeper happening to us, as a county and as a people, that we have yet to reckon with. Something very near to the surface that the events of <em> Come Knocking </em> illustrate, almost perfectly, and that something is this: I think we are very, very scared and very, very selfish.</p><p>One need not look very far in the culture to see evidence of people who are one unkind word away from snapping. Search Reddit for “Karens” or “Tales from the Front Desk,” listen to boomers complaining about millennials or millennials complaining about boomers, or, the next time you’re at a restaurant, ask your server how their night is going. In any case, you will find fountains of entitlement, horror stories of mistreatment and anger, all of which seems to be happening everywhere. Whether it’s in a big city or the country, people are eager to tell others how important they are, how they deserve certain things, and how much everyone else is terrible. But not them. Never them.</p><p>What you’ll find in these interviews are stories of performers with a passion butting heads with an audience who, in some cases, feel as if they have the right to do whatever it is they want, including, in some circumstances, hurt and kill. You will find audiences approaching performers in good spirits only to be hurt in the process. And, most tragically, you’ll find people in search of a powerful experience finding only horror in the hallways of the Netherworld.</p><p>Ultimately, that is what spoke to me about this story. It’s not just about a tragic, bloody night. It’s a story about how we got to the point where this tragic, bloody night was</p><p>—Adam Jakes</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81EtSbRT4bL._SL1500_.jpg
