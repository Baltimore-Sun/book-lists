Treatment plans that focus on the mind are only addressing the downstream effects. Likewise, common medical approaches to manage symptoms fail to explore root causes and promote genuine recovery.</p><p>If we want to truly heal, we need to understand trauma as something happening inside of the body—not as a singular external event. Gaining clarity on how our bodies hold onto experiences, impacting both our physical health and our ability to maintain healthy behaviors and relationships, is crucial.

But when he takes up residence at a historic bed-and-breakfast on the Cape, he encounters a beautiful young woman named Wren who will challenge every assumption he has about his logical and controlled world.</p><p>Tate and Wren find themselves forging an immediate connection, one that neither has ever experienced before. But Tate gradually discovers that below the surface of Wren’s idyllic small-town life, hatred, jealousy, and greed are festering, threatening their fragile relationship just as it begins to blossom. Tate realizes that in order to free Wren from an increasingly desperate fate, he will need to unearth the truth about her past before time runs out . . . a quest that will make him doubt whether we can ever believe the stories we tell about ourselves, and the laws that govern our existence.

The English edition was done by the revered translation duo of Howard Goldblatt and Sylvia Li-chun Lin. It's an elegiac short novel, a reflection of a man who, as the title suggests, tunes pianos. But, of course, along the way, from Taipei to New York, he tries to retune his life.</p><p>It’s slow and methodical, and that’s kind of the point. Kuo lingers on the stuff we all think about but don’t say out loud: old regrets, missed chances, and the bizarre and quiet ways everyone processes loss.</p><p>The novel itself is drenched in music—from Rachmaninoff, Schubert, Glenn Gould, and Richter—and is highly evocative of a certain mood. Think <em>Snow Country</em> by Kawabata, and you're getting the picture.</p><p>It's not overly sad or dramatic. It’s calm, a little haunting, and strangely comforting. Long hailed in Taiwan as a “writer’s writer,” Chiang-Sheng Kuo delivers a stunningly powerful, compact novel in <em>The Piano Tuner</em>.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DXRspdbhL._SL1500_.jpg

When God planned to give us souls a physical shape, we refused to enter into a concrete form that would fall ill and grow old, obstructing our free passage through time and space. God came up with a solution by having angels play enchanting music.</p><p> We souls were so spellbound by the music we wanted to hear it more clearly, which was possible only through one channel, the human ear. God’s trick worked, and we souls gained a physical body.</p></br></br><p>What happened next ought to start with Rachmaninoff, heard through Lin <em>san</em>’s ears.</p><p> *</p><p> The music came from the second-floor practice room.</p><p> Lin had not heard the story of souls losing their freedom over a pair of ears. He had, in fact, just experienced a different kind of loss.</p><p> Three months after his wife’s death, he’d finally pulled himself together enough to deal with the studio she’d run.</p><p> She had poured her heart and soul into the studio, attracting an enthusiastic following in the neighborhood. Then why hadn’t she left a word about it during her last days? Maybe she’d felt bad about burdening him with the task of keeping the place going, he reflected. She knew that an amateur music lover like him would likely close up shop unless she asked him not to.</p><p> That speculation assuaged his guilt feelings somewhat, for, after all, before meeting Emily, he hadn’t been able to tell a violin from a viola.</p><p> Three months had gone by and classes were ending. The instructors and students had all been notified of the closure.</p><p> It was the first time he’d been to the studio since her death, and he had waited until after nine at night, when the last session was over and he would not be subjected to reproachful looks from the newly jobless instructors. They would not say anything, but he would find their awkward attempts to avoid him unbearable.</p><p> His first marriage had lasted six years before ending in divorce. This one was over even sooner, a short four years, before Emily had time to turn him into a true lover of classical music. The cancer had come out of the blue and with a vengeance. She was gone in six months.</p><p> He was twenty years older than her. The thought of getting remarried had given him pause, fearing that one day he might be a burden to a young wife. He never imagined that it might end the way it did.</p></br></br><p>With the door to the practice room ajar, the lyrical notes of a piano came through crisply in the night air.</p><p> Emily had dragged him to a good many concerts, including her own recitals, but there were few pieces he could recognize right off. Surprised by the piano strains emerging from upstairs, he paused in his conversation with the studio manager and instinctively looked up in the direction of the music.</p><p> It was Rachmaninoff ’s “Song Without Words.”</p></br></br><p>With the door to the practice room ajar, the lyrical notes of a piano came through crisply in the night air.</p><p> Emily had dragged him to a good many concerts, including her own recitals, but there were few pieces he could recognize right off. Surprised by the piano strains emerging from upstairs, he paused in his conversation with the studio manager and instinctively looked up in the direction of the music.</p><p> It was Rachmaninoff ’s “Song Without Words.”</p></br></br><p>Emily’s violin had introduced him to the tune on the eve of their first anniversary.</p><p> He’d gotten her a surprise gift, neither jewelry nor an expensive purse, but a self-sponsored recital. Overjoyed, she began by making him an audience of one in their living room, where she played the whole program for him. Only the Rachmaninoff piece inspired a strong reaction and deep emotions. The string version sounded unusually sorrowful, which may have led to thoughts of his mother, who had passed away a few years earlier.</p></br></br><p>“Seems awfully sad,” he’d said.</p><p> Emily graciously replaced it with another selection for the recital. Yet the melody was etched on his mind. Like an audio allergen, an earworm, he seemed to hear it all the time; from a soprano’s plaintive rendition to a cello performance, from car commercials to movie background music, the piece popped up around him in ever-shifting forms.</p><p> But on this night, when he heard the piano version in the empty studio, not only was it missing that grave quality, it actually sounded weightless, expansive, somewhat hazy.</p><p> “Who’s that playing so late at night?” he asked the studio director.</p><p> From the moment he arrived, the moonfaced woman had tried to force a sad look onto her naturally happy countenance, but now, with this question taking her mind off her expression, she could relax.</p><p> “Oh, that’s our piano tuner.”</p><p> “Hasn’t he been told to stop coming?”</p><p> “Yes, but he said he was happy to provide free service before the pianos are taken away.”</p><p> Lin frowned but said nothing.</p><p> (God, what am I going to do with all the pianos?)</p><p> “He plays beautifully but said no when I asked if he’d like to offer lessons.” She added, “Sometimes we let him use the room for free.”</p><p> “How much do we pay him?”</p><p>“Fifteen hundred an hour.”</p><p>Appallingly paltry pay compared to that of a teacher. A businessman at his core, Lin intuitively considered the difference in salary.</p><p>Having no piano of his own and refusing to teach, just happy to be a tuner. To Lin, that seemed irrational.</p><p>“He’s pretty good.”</p><p>He commented spontaneously. It was, after all, his music studio. If his judgment was off, so what?</p><p>“That’s what Instructor Chen said too.”</p><p>Emily had always been Instructor Chen. He, on the other hand, had been the man behind the woman, old enough to be her father. So the staff called him Mr. Lin but called her Instructor Chen, as if unsure of their relationship.</p><p>He climbed the stairs slowly, drawn to the music.</p><p>It truly sounded different from the versions he’d heard, for there was a dreamy sweetness to it, like awakened memories of events long after they ended.</p><p>(Sooner or later these melodies too will disappear from my life.)</p><p>When he reached the top of the stairs, he looked into the only lighted practice room. A man in a baseball cap sat at the upright piano just beyond the partly opened door.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DXRspdbhL._SL1500_.jpg
