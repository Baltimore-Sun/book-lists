Confronting Bad History—How a Lost Cause and Fraudulent Book Caused the John Wilkes Booth Exhumation Trial,Recommended Books,,Francis Gorman,Hardcover,Gateway Park Publishing,"January 23, 2025",979-8218516628,"<p>The President’s assassination in 1865 irrevocably joined Lincoln and Booth. The full history of Lincoln's presidency cannot be told without Booth, and the life of Booth is defined by his dastardly deed. How Booth met his fate cannot change Lincoln's life and presidency, but it can diminish the trust in our own history.</p> <p>John Wilkes Booth was captured, shot, and died at Garrett Farm in Virginia on April 26, 1865. This is the traditional history, but it was contradicted by a 1907 book entitled <em>The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth</em> written by Finis L. Bates for the ""correction of history."" The book ebbed in and out of public consciousness over the years, until two Booth escape proponents talked <em>Unsolved Mysteries </em>into producing the Bates escape story in an episode aired in 1991. This emboldened the escape proponents to request the exhumation of Booth's remains buried in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore. An impasse was reached, and the proponents sued to force an exhumation, relying on the Bates book, resulting in a sixteen-witness trial in May 1995 that included anthropologists, a medical examiner, history scholars, and historians.</p> <p>In <em>Confronting Bad History</em>, Frank Gorman, who represented the Cemetery at trial, recounts the trial preparations and strategies, lining up expert witnesses, the historical testimony and evidence, and trial tactics. He describes the overwhelming testimony and evidence showing that the Bates book is unreliable and fraudulent, with citations to the trial testimony in the Appendix. He also exposes the Bates book as a Lost Cause false narrative. Yet the Booth escape story persists today, in large part because the 1995 trial is either unknown or ignored. This book gives voice to the trial that confronted bad history and confirms that Booth met his fate at Garrett Farm.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pP08Whb6L._SL1429_.jpg
"My Father's Cabin: A Tale of Life, Loss, and Land",Recommended Books,,Mark Phillips,Hardcover,Arcade,"May 6, 2025",978-1648211140,"<p>In the Rust Belt of the 1960s, a blue-collar father works double shifts, chasing elusive dreams: a good night's sleep, eternal life, a cabin in the Allegheny Mountains where he can hunt and fish. His son is a child of the times, chasing his own dreams: girls, long hair, politics, and independence. And both chase the same dream: each other's elusive love. This is a familiar story uniquely told, in a voice that perfectly captures America at its most turbulent, an era that continues to define the largest generation in American history. <em>My Father's Cabin</em> chronicles life in America as the Greatest Generation gives way to the Me Decade, as responsibility gives way to self-fulfillment-and then back again, as responsibility becomes self-fulfillment.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SicXwgZmL._SL1500_.jpg
Agents of Change: The Women Who Transformed the CIA,Recommended Books,,"By Christina Hillsberg, Foreword by Valerie Plame",Hardcover,Citadel,"June 24, 2025",978-0806543499,"<p><strong>The timely and revelatory exploration of the pioneering women who changed the insulated world of international espionage—from the barrier-crashing challenges of the 1960s to the present-day reckoning—told through the eyes of a former intelligence operative herself.</strong><br /> <br /> Years after her successful and impactful career at the CIA, Christina Hillsberg became enthralled with the stories of the trailblazing women who forged new paths within the Agency long before she began her career there in the aughts. These were women who sacrificed their personal lives, risked their safety, defied expectations, and boldly navigated the male-dominated spy organization.</p> <p>Through exclusive interviews with current and former female CIA officers, many of whom have never spoken publicly, <em>Agents of Change</em> tells an enthralling and, at times, disturbing story set against the backdrop of the evolving women’s movement. It was in the 1960s, a “secretarial” era, when women first gained a foothold and pushed against the one-dimensional, pop-culture trope of the sexy Cold War Bond Girl. Underestimated but undaunted, they fought their way, decade by decade, through adversity to the top of the spy game.</p> <p>Seamlessly weaving together the individual stories of these exceptional women, Hillsberg deftly tackles not just the fight for gender equality at the CIA but also the current dilemma the Agency faces when dealing with the culmination of a decades-long culture of sexual harassment and assault. Each chapter sheds a light on women’s issues during a different decade before bringing to life the stories of female CIA operations officers whose experiences were emblematic of that given era. In this fascinating and empowering chronicle, Hillsberg takes readers inside the Agency in a way that’s never been done before, paying long-overdue tribute to the survivors and thrivers, the indispensable groundbreakers, and the defiant rabble-rousers who made the choice to change their lives and, in turn, changed history.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jaXPCYDoL._SL1500_.jpg
Human History on Drugs: An Utterly Scandalous but Entirely Truthful Look at History Under the Influence,Recommended Books,,Sam Kelly,Paperback,Plume,"July 8, 2025",978-0593476048,"<p><strong>A lively, hilarious, and entirely truthful look at the druggie side of history’s most famous figures, including Shakespeare, George Washington, the Beatles, and more<br /> <br /> </strong>Did you know that Alexander the Great was a sloppy drunk and William Shakespeare was a stoner? Or how about the fact that Steve Jobs believed taking LSD helped him create the Apple computer, or that Sigmund Freud loved cocaine so much he took it all the time and prescribed it to his patients?</p> <p>In <em>Human History on Drugs</em>, Sam Kelly introduces us to the history our teachers never told us, offering up irreverent and insightful commentary as he sheds light on some truly bizarre aspects of the historical characters we only thought we knew. With chapters spanning from Ancient Greece (“The Oracle of Delphi Was Huffing Fumes”) to modern times (“Carl Sagan Got Astronomically High”), Kelly's research covers all manner of eras, places, and, of course, drugs.</p> <p>History is rife with drug use and drug users, and <em>Human History on Drugs</em> takes us through those highs (pun intended) and lows on a witty and entertaining ride that uncovers their mind-boggling impact on our past.</p>",http://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IU2ldwr5L._SL1500_.jpg
Vivienne,Recommended Books,,Emmalea Russo,Paperback,Arcade,"June 24, 2025",978-1648211485,"<p>It’s rare for an extraordinary novelist to become known as a towering poet (Thomas Hardy, Bronte, DH Lawrence, Robert Graves) and perhaps rarer for a towering poet to become known as an extraordinary novelist—but such became the case of celebrated poet Emmalea Russo with the release of her first novel, <em>Vivienne</em>. A dense but slender-feeling exegesis of family, madness, love, and art, the book is sui generis in our nervous, fussily curated, monstrous time: a surrealistic, contemporaneous, sensual tapestry of the vagaries of repressive <em>Kultur</em>—and the timelessness of the twin shocks of great art and epic desire. I won’t dishonor <em>Vivienne</em> by rote précis because ekphrastic summary is so listless in the face of its achievement; suffice to say the three V’s of the book come from three gens—the storied artist and grand-matriarch Vivienne, her moodily complex daughter Velour, and Velour’s wild-child offspring Vesta (a Virgo whose name was inspired by the Vestal Virgin who is so much a part of Virgoan mythology). Acerbic and deliriously funny as well, the dream of <em>Vivienne</em> is built from prose that embodies the muscular, ethereal confidence wrought by years of celestial labor in the heavy-metal, alchemical ironworks of poetry. Maurice Blanchot said, “In his world, nothing, nothing but the desire to dream.” It’s Russo’s world he speaks of. Holding the book in one’s hands is enough to blast open the portals of a melodrama that is both minimalist and operatic, wounding and healing, dark and blindingly bright.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91+hUKNw8HL._SL1500_.jpg

Do Not Chase<strong>! </strong>reads the sign tacked to the tree at the far edge of Velour Bellmer’s yard. The dog is called Pepper, a name Velour finds predictably ridiculous, partly because she knows the owner, Lisa, a shrieky woman with fake nails and a mild speed habit. The dog, a tiny yappy thing who resembles Lisa, has been missing for a few days, and as Velour sits at the kitchen table over a coffee with cream and sugar, she glares at the sign while stirring, the gone dog’s face glowing beneath streetlight as the hot liquid spins.</p> <p>The house, a white saltbox, looks miniature in the shade of the gargantuan trees stippling the vast, flat yard which spreads then dissolves into a cornfield. Velour’s home sits alone and its insides are larger and more elaborate than you’d think: labyrinthine and sticky, lined with surreal wallpaper that Velour made and applied herself several years ago, a damask pattern of brown, black, and dark purple with occasional white eyeballs shot through with red.</p> <p>Today, the house’s eggshell facade is outshone by the bright white snow falling in large chunks, then clasping green-black grass. Velour likes to wake at least an hour before the sun. When everyone’s asleep, she can stare into inky space. Velour’s husband, an artist-slash-restaurant manager, overdosed on heroin three years ago at the shiny white kitchen table she’s sitting at now. Vesta, her seven-year-old, wakes at seven and bolts downstairs with the dog. Velour’s eighty-two-year-old mother, Vivienne arrives in the kitchen soon after, brooding, chatting, reaching for the cigs. Velour is not the first one up. Lou, Vivienne’s forty-year-old boyfriend, has already left for work.</p> <p>Velour is sure that fate or God—someone, something—is playing sick cosmic tricks on her. Her young daughter is becoming more like her mother each day: alarmingly charming, moody, and suddenly cruel, with capable technician hands and a bonkers artist heart. Velour exhales, trancing into the field. Yes, there are simply too many beings living in her house. Her gaze wanders again toward the image of the skinny chihuahua. Stolen or roadkill by now, she thinks.</p> <p>As the matte and wide winter sky brightens, Velour pours two splashes of whiskey into her coffee, opens her laptop, and looks over her notes from yesterday. <em>Fuck, </em>she mutters, lighting another cigarette and leaning back. Outside, the snow slows. If you were to look in the kitchen window from the Lost Dog sign, Velour’s body would be a small white mass, crumpled and twitchy over the table. Three pre-dawn deer in the field and a red-tailed hawk overhead circling.</p> <p>Velour yearns to be as empty and gone as the edge of the yard the moment it gets eaten by the meadow. There are zero signs of the impending holiday. She has not decorated and the multicolored Christmas lights of town are not visible from here.</p> <p>Velour’s days have been monotone since her husband’s overdose. Write, research, clean, chat with her mother and Vesta, rinse and repeat. The quietude is new. Velour’s childhood felt like a fast car outgunning something amorphous and many-eyed. Her twenties are a blur of New York City parties and flashes of light accompanied by spurts of insight.</p> <p>When Velour met Max Furio, this raucous uncertainty continued, as she spent a large portion of her days worrying she’d find him dead. When she finally <em>did</em>, a humming possibility fulfilled, everything went snow-mute and dumb. She started to write poems, sketch, and drink—not much—just enough to stay tilted, off kilter, warm. She upped, too, the time she spent researching the work and lives of her father, Hans Bellmer, who died before she was born, and her mother, Vivienne Volker, Hans’s final lover.</p> <p>The first serious change since Max’s death occurred back in July when Vivienne received word that her work would appear in the NAT Museum’s swanky exhibition of forgotten female Surrealists. Vivienne would be the only living artist in the show, which she saw as an ominous honor. Her mother sets the tone. Velour knows. Vortex-like, everyone’s moods get sucked into hers and spat back out, Vivienne-hued. And after the news, she began to think again of her old life, the manic madness of those days in Paris. That’s how Vivienne refers to her past—<em>those days in Paris. </em>Suddenly, Velour’s world was infiltrated, too—<em>those days in Paris. Those days, those days. </em>Vivienne regaled the household with stories of making clothes for disturbing dolls out of trash and scraps. She relayed how she conceived her artworks, and at the dinner table one night, told everyone how she conceived Velour, too:</p> <p>Born in France in 1975, Velour was conceived mystically! I swear. Her obsession with endings, finalities, fatalities so obviously corresponds to the fact that it was her father’s final secretion that made her. Back then, everything felt fatal, dreamlike, and automatic. I was mad . . . a little . . . sure.</p> <p>She even began to spontaneously speak French and doubled (at least) her time at church. Since Vivienne’s rediscovery, Vesta has been more deranged than usual, too. Running manically around with the dog, she takes things apart (board games, for instance) and tapes the pieces to her walls, attempts to shove her fallen baby teeth back up into her gums, on and on. When the school called in September asking if perhaps Vesta needed ADHD meds, Vivienne screamed <em>CHILD POISONERS! </em>before abruptly hanging up, she and Lou laughing hysterically while galloping up the spiral staircase. Yes, Vivienne’s impending comeback had certainly electrocuted this home and its sinuous residents. Velour feels herself to be the only normal one.</p> <p>This morning, staring into her coffee as it stops spinning, Velour feels that things are about to shift, again. She can almost—almost—almost—see the end.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91+hUKNw8HL._SL1500_.jpg
