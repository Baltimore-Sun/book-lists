Every Day I Read: 53 Ways to Get Closer to Books,Recommended Books,,"Hwang Bo-reum, translated by Shanna Tan",Hardcover,Bloomsbury Publishing,"December 2, 2025",978-1639737796,"<p><strong>From the author of the international bestseller <em>Welcome to the Hyunam-dong Bookshop</em>, a heartfelt invitation to reflect on your relationship with reading and celebrate the joys of books.</strong><br /> <br /> Why do we read? What is it that we hope to take away from the intimate, personal experience of reading for pleasure?</p><p>How often do we ask these profound, expansive questions of ourselves and of our relationship to the joy of reading? In each of the essays in <em>Every Day I Read</em>, Hwang Bo-reum contemplates what living a life immersed in reading means. She goes beyond the usual questions of what to read and how often, exploring the relationship between reading and writing, when to turn to a bestseller vs. browse the corners of a bookstore, the value of reading outside of your favorite genre, falling in love with book characters, and more.</p><p><em>Every Day I Read</em> provides many quiet moments for introspection and reflection, encouraging book-lovers to explore what reading means to each of us. While this is a book about books, at its heart is an attitude to life, one outside capitalism and climbing the corporate ladder. Lifelong and new readers will take inspiration from it, including a treasure trove of book recommendations blended seamlessly within.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91E1V4lE9IL._SL1500_.jpg
Television: A Novel of Luck,Recommended Books,,Lauren Rothery,Hardcover,Ecco,"December 2, 2025",978-0063443327,"<p><strong><em>Some people you meet them and you imagine this movie together. The two of you make a kind of movie and then it’s over. Other people, what you imagine isn’t a movie, because it keeps going. It’s television . . . If you can’t see how romantic television is, you’re blind.</em></strong><br /> <br /> An aging, A-list movie star lotteries off the entirety of his mega-million blockbuster salary to a member of the general viewing public before taking up with a much younger model. His non-famous best friend (and often lover) looks on impassively, while recollecting their twenty-odd years of unlikely connection. And an aspiring filmmaker, unknown to them both, labors over a script about best friends and lovers while longing for the financial freedom to make great art.</p><p>Told in their alternating, intricately linked perspectives, <em>Television</em> is a funny, philosophically astute novel about phenomenal luck, whether windfall or chance encounter. Like Joan Didion’s classic <em>Play It as It Lays</em>, but speaking to a since irrevocably changed Hollywood, it portrays a culture in crisis and the disparities in wealth, beauty, talent, gender, and youth at the heart of contemporary American life. In this glittering but strange new world, lit up by social media and streaming services—what, if not love, can be counted in your favor?</p><p>With plays in chronology, bright, nimble dialogue, and a profoundly modern style, Lauren Rothery’s debut novel is an arresting feat of literary impressionism, and marks the arrival of a significant new talent to the landscape of American fiction.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TcgG2mzQL._SL1500_.jpg
Capitalism: A Global History,Recommended Books,,Sven Beckert,Hardcover,Penguin Press,"November 25, 2025",978-0735220836,"<p><strong>A landmark event years in the making, a brilliant global narrative that unravels the defining story of the past thousand years of human history</strong><br /> <br /> No other phenomenon has shaped human history as decisively as capitalism. It structures how we live and work, how we think about ourselves and others, how we organize our politics. Sven Beckert, author of the Bancroft Prize–winning <em>Empire of Cotton</em>, places the story of capitalism within the largest conceivable geographical and historical framework, tracing its history during the past millennium and across the world. An epic achievement, his book takes us into merchant businesses in Aden and car factories in Turin, onto the terrifyingly violent sugar plantations in Barbados, and within the world of women workers in textile factories in today’s Cambodia.</p><p>By chronicling capitalism’s global history, Beckert exposes the reality of the system that now seems simply “natural.” It is said that people can more easily imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. If there is one ultimate lesson in this extraordinary book, it’s how to leave that behind. Though cloaked in a false timelessness and universality, capitalism is, in reality, a recent human invention. Sven Beckert doesn’t merely tote up capitalism’s debits and credits. He shows us how to look through and beyond it to imagine a different and larger world.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712n8jq8knL._SL1500_.jpg
A Parent's Guide to Healthy Children: From Preconception to Early Childhood,Recommended Books,,Children's Health Defense,Paperback,Children's Health Defense,"December 9, 2025",978-1648211935,"<p>All good parents share a purpose: to protect their precious gift and raise vibrant, healthy, and happy children. Parents are their children’s best advocates, and they must be able to make health decisions with confidence. Unfortunately, we live in a toxic world, and our children are getting sicker and sicker. Currently, more than half of them live with chronic conditions that negatively affect their quality of life—a fact strongly linked to a medical paradigm that emphasizes high-tech and pharmaceutical interventions over healthier options. If we are to turn this situation around—and make our children healthy again—parents clearly need a better way.</p><p><em>A Parent’s Guide to Healthy Children</em> offers that better way, empowering new and expectant parents with gentle, natural, and holistic ways to promote their children’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being—from preconception through early childhood. Readers will learn how to deal effectively with pregnancy discomfort, make evidence-based birth choices that do not induce trauma, choose health-promoting foods and supplements that provide optimal nutrition for their child’s development, and eliminate or minimize hidden toxic exposures. Other topics that are vital to keeping kids’ development on track include the importance of infant reflexes, how to promote and maintain the diversity of a child’s microbiome, and how to spot “red flags”—early signs of immune or neurological dysfunction.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, this guide will help parents confidently navigate common childhood illnesses. That confidence means they will not be at the mercy of medical practitioners more concerned with “standard of care” than the health of the children in their care.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61c-dGbAfvL._SL1500_.jpg

But <em>The Garlic Ballads</em> is one of his books that deserves more (yes more) attention.</p><p>In <em>The Garlic Ballads, </em>the government engages in a sadistic cat and mouse game with the farmers of the inaptly named Paradise County. But when the garlic won’t sell, the warehouses overflow, and taxes are precipitously raised; Kafkaesque punishments ensue. Families are destroyed by the random imprisonment of young and old for supposed crimes against the state. Prison awaits.</p><p>A blind minstrel spurs the masses to take the law into their own hands, and a riot of apocalyptic proportions follows with savage consequences. <em>The Garlic Ballads</em>, an Arcade Publishing classic of world literature, is a powerful vision of rebellion but an epic love story as well—between man and woman, father and child, friend and friend—and the struggle for dignity against diabolical odds.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81uNURd6WeL._SL1500_.jpg

A flock of indigo crows flew wearily across the sky, casting a shadowy wedge. There had been no time to braid the garlic, which lay in heaps, reeking as it baked in the sun. Gao Yang, whose eyebrows sloped downward at the ends, was squatting alongside a table, holding a bowl of garlic broth and fighting back the waves of nausea rising from his stomach. The urgent shout had come in through his unlatched gate as he was about to take a sip of the broth. He recognized the voice as belonging to the village boss, Gao Jinjiao. Hastily laying down his bowl, he shouted a reply and walked to the door. ""Is that you, Uncle Jinjiao? Come on in.""</p><p>This time the voice was gentler. ""Gao Yang, come out here for a minute. I have to talk to you about something.""</p><p>Knowing the consequences of slighting the village boss, Gao Yang turned to his blind eight-year-old daughter, who sat frozen at the table like a dark statue, her black, beautiful, sightless eyes opened wide. ""Don't touch anything, Xinghua, or you might scald yourself""</p><p>Baked earth burned the soles of his feet; the intense heat made his eyes water. With the sun beating down on his bare back, he scraped caked-on dirt from his chest. He heard the cry of his newborn baby on the kang, a brick platform that served as the family's bed, and thought he heard his wife mumble something. Finally, he had a son. It was a comforting thought. The fragrance of new millet drifted up on a southwestern breeze, reminding him that harvest was approaching. Suddenly his heart sank, and a chill worked its way up his spine. He wanted desperately to stop walking, but his legs kept propelling him forward, as the pungent odor of garlic stalks and bulbs made his eyes water. He raised his bare arm to wipe them, confident that he wasn't crying.</p><p>He opened the gate. ""What is it, Uncle?"" he asked. ""Ow! . . . Mother—!"" Emerald bits streaked past him, like millions of green garlic stalks swirling in the air; something struck his right ankle, a dull, heavy, gut-wrenching blow. Momentarily stunned, he closed his eyes and assumed that the sound he heard was his own scream as he slumped to one side. Another dull thud behind his left knee. He screamed in pain—there was no denying it this time—and pitched forward, winding up on his knees on the stone steps. Dazed, he tried to open his eyes, but the lids were too heavy, and the pungent, garlicky air drew tears. Still, he knew he wasn't crying. He raised his hand to rub his eyes, only to discover that his wrists were snared painfully by something cold and hard; two faint metallic clicks knifed into his brain.</p><p>Finally he opened his eyes. Through the film of tears-I'm not crying, he thought-he saw two policemen in white tunics and green pants with red stripes down the legs; they towered over him, pale smudges on their pants and dark stains on their tunics. But what caught his attention were the pistols and the dark nightsticks that hung from wide, cordovan-colored, artificial-leather belts cinching up their tunics. The buckles glinted in the sun. He looked up into the men's expressionless faces, but before he could utter a sound, the man on the left waved a sheet of paper with an official red seal in front of him and said with a slight stammer, ""Y-you're under arrest.""</p><p>That was when he noticed the shiny steel bracelets on his sunburned wrists. They were linked by a slack, heavy, silvery chain that swayed lazily when he raised his hands. A powerful shudder wracked him. The blood flowed sluggishly through his veins, and he felt himself shrinking: his testicles retreated into his body and his guts knotted up. Chilled drops of urine on his thighs informed him that he was peeing his pants, and he tried to hold it back. But the lilting, mournful cries of the blind minstrel Zhang Kou's two-stringed <em>erhu </em>reached his ears, and his muscles turned slack and useless; an icy stream of urine ran down his leg, soaked his buttocks, and washed the callused soles of his feet as he knelt. He actually heard it slosh around in his crotch.</p><p>The policeman on the left took Gao Yang's arm in his ice-cold hand to help him up. Another slight stammer. ""G-get up.""</p><p>Still dazed, Gao Yang reached for the policeman's arm, but the handcuffs, clanking softly, dug into his flesh and forced him to let go. Fearfully, he held his arms stiffiy out in front, as if cupping a precious, fragile object.</p><p>""G-get up!"" The policeman's order rang out. He struggled to his feet, but was no sooner standing than a searing pain tore through his ankle. He lurched sideways and fell to his hands and knees on the stone steps.</p><p>The policemen grabbed him under the arms and picked him up. But his legs were so rubbery that his gangly frame dangled in their grasp like a pendulum. The policeman on his right drove his knee into Gao Yang's tailbone. ""Stand up!"" he growled. ""What happened to the hero who demolished the county offices?""</p><p>The comment was lost on Gao Yang, but the rock-hard knee against his tailbone helped him forget the pain in his ankle. With a shudder he planted his feet and stood up. The policemen loosened their grip, and the one with the stammer said softly, ""G-get moving, and h-hurry.""</p><p>His head was swimming, but he remained confident that he wasn't crying, even as hot tears welled up and spilled over to cloud his vision. The handcuffs dug deeply into his wrists each time he was shoved forward, and he suddenly—finally—realized what was happening. He knew he had to find the will to force his stiffened tongue to move: not daring to address his tormentors, he gazed pitifully at Gao Jinjiao, who was cowering beneath an acacia tree, and said, ""Uncle, why are they arresting me? I haven't done anything wrong. . . .""</p><p>Wails and sobs followed. This time he knew he was crying, even though no tears flowed from his now dry, burning eyes. He must plead his case to the village boss, who had tricked him into coming outside in the first place. But Gao Jinjiao was rocking back and forth, bumping against the tree like a penitent little boy. A muscle on Gao Yang's face twitched. ""I haven't done anything, Uncle, why did you trick me like that?"" He was shouting. A large bead of sweat on the village boss's forehead refused to roll down. With his yellow teeth bared, he looked like a cornered man about to break and run.</p><p>The policeman again drove his knee into Gao Yang's tailbone to get him moving. ""Comrade Officer,"" he protested, turning to look into the man's face, ""you've got the wrong man. My name's Gao Yang. I'm not—""</p><p>""W-we've got the right man,"" the stammerer insisted. ""My name's Gao Yang....""</p><p>""Gao Yang is who we want!"" ""What did I do?""</p><p>""At noon on May twenty-eighth you were one of the leaders of a mob that demolished the county offices.""</p><p>The lights went out as Gao Yang crumpled to the ground. When they picked him up again, he rolled his eyes and said timidly, ""You call that a <em>crime?""</em></p><p>""That's right—now get moving!""</p><p>""But I wasn't alone. Lots of people were involved.""</p><p>“And we'll catch every last one of them.""</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81uNURd6WeL._SL1500_.jpg
