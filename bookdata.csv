Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America,Recommended Books,,Sam Tanenhaus,Hardcover,Random House,"June 3, 2025",978-0375502347,"<p>In 1951, with the publication of <em>God and Man at Yale</em>, a scathing attack on his alma mater, twenty-five-year-old William F. Buckley, Jr., seized the public stage—and commanded it for the next half century as he led a new generation of conservative activists and ideologues to the peak of political power and cultural influence.</p> <p>Ten years before his death in 2008, Buckley chose prize-winning biographer Sam Tanenhaus to tell the full, uncensored story of his life and times, granting him extensive interviews and exclusive access to his most private papers. Thus began a deep investigation into the vast and often hidden universe of Bill Buckley and the modern conservative revolution.</p> <p><em>Buckley </em>vividly captures its subject in all his facets and phases: founding editor of <em>National Review, </em>the twentieth century’s most influential political journal; syndicated columnist, Emmy-winning TV debater, and bestselling spy novelist; ally of Joseph McCarthy and Barry Goldwater; mentor to Ronald Reagan; game-changing candidate for mayor of New York.</p> <p>Tanenhaus also has uncovered the darker trail of Bill Buckley’s secret exploits, including CIA missions in Latin America, dark collusions with Watergate felon Howard Hunt, and Buckley’s struggle in his last years to hold together a movement coming apart over the AIDS epidemic, culture wars, and the invasion of Iraq—even as his own media empire was unraveling.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qvB-04xOL._SL1500_.jpg
Murderland: Crime and Bloodlust in the Time of Serial Killers,Recommended Books,,Caroline Fraser,Hardcover,Penguin Press,"June 10, 2025",978-0593657225,"<p><strong>From the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of <em>Prairie Fires</em> comes a terrifying true-crime history of serial killers in the Pacific Northwest and beyond—a gripping investigation of how a new strain of psychopath emerged out of a toxic landscape of deadly industrial violence</strong><br /> <br /> Caroline Fraser grew up in the shadow of Ted Bundy, the most notorious serial murderer of women in American history, surrounded by his hunting grounds and mountain body dumps, in the brooding landscape of the Pacific Northwest. But in the 1970s and ’80s, Bundy was just one perpetrator amid an uncanny explosion of serial rape and murder across the region. Why so many? Why so weirdly and nightmarishly gruesome? Why the senseless rise and then sudden fall of an epidemic of serial killing?</p> <p>As <em>Murderland</em> indelibly maps the lives and careers of Bundy and his infamous peers in mayhem—the Green River Killer, the I-5 Killer, the Night Stalker, the Hillside Strangler, even Charles Manson—Fraser’s Northwestern death trip begins to uncover a deeper mystery and an overlapping pattern of environmental destruction. At ground zero in Ted Bundy’s Tacoma stood one of the most poisonous lead, copper, and arsenic smelters in the world, but it was hardly unique in the West. As Fraser’s investigation inexorably proceeds, evidence mounts that the plumes of these smelters not only sickened and blighted millions of lives but also warped young minds, including some who grew up to become serial killers.</p> <p>A propulsive nonfiction thriller, <em>Murderland</em> transcends true-crime voyeurism and noir mythology, taking readers on a profound quest into the dark heart of the real American berserk.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91tQG98852L._SL1500_.jpg
Some Future Day: How AI Is Going to Change Everything,Recommended Books,,Marc Beckman,Hardcover,Skyhorse,"January 14, 2025",978-1648210778,"<p><strong>This cutting-edge guide not only shows how AI is transforming our careers, lives, businesses, and more, but also provides easy, actionable steps to make AI work for us.</strong><br /> <br /> In this groundbreaking book, celebrated professor, entrepreneur, author, and podcaster Marc Beckman explores the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) and how it’s poised to enhance and transform all aspects of society—revolutionizing our careers, enriching our family lives, and bringing our communities closer together. From business and advertising, to medicine, to warfare, to politics—Beckman meticulously explores the different areas where we’ll soon feel AI’s transformative impact. But that’s only half of it. Throughout this book, he also provides the specific steps readers can take <strong>now</strong> to make sure these coming changes work for them.</p> <p>From the workplace to the home, AI is poised to reshape the way we approach our professional and personal lives. Beckman uses this book to make the case that AI will free up valuable time and energy, allowing individuals to focus on more creative and meaningful work, but also that AI will create possibilities for engagement that were unthinkable just a generation ago. He shows that with AI as our co-pilot, we’ll unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and collaboration—all of which will lead to more fulfilling and rewarding careers. Beckman illustrates how AI will strengthen family bonds and improve the quality of our home lives too, changing everything from how we educate our kids to how we stay connected on social media. And as AI becomes more integrated into our cities and towns, it will play a crucial role in fostering a sense of community and belonging; through AI-powered platforms, Beckman shows how we will collaborate on projects, share resources, and support one another in times of need.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AQmpQKMpL._SL1500_.jpg

Hopkins has already been compared to Vonnegut, Bradbury, and Pynchon, and the author’s gorgeous, newly edited hardcover edition from Arcade is a brash, essential step-up from the previous paperback.</p> <blockquote><p>During the four weird weeks that followed, while the Normals were celebrating Easter, Passover, Resurrection Day, Egg-white Omelet Day, and the scores of other vernal holidays no one could remember why they were celebrating, Taylor’s paranoia mounted.</p></blockquote> <p>Nietzsche is dead; long live C. J. Hopkins and the uproarious horrors he rode (and wrote) in on.</p> <p><em>Zone 23</em> reads like one of the mind-bending compounds discovered by the infamous, legendary psychopharmacologist Alexander Shulgin—strangely, the book <em>itself</em> is the antidote for the very depression it induces. It’s also wildly prophetic, scary, and scabrously funny.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SunWInIdL._SL1500_.jpg

It’s full of heart, humanity, humour and riotous defiance. As a warning and provocation it sits alongside the literary sci-fi classics by Vonnegut, Bradbury and Pynchon.”<br /><strong>—EWAN MORRISON, author of <em>For Emma</em></strong><br /> <br /> “[A] witty, nasty, erudite, Pynchonesque narrative, full of fleshed-out sleazy characters and a hyper-detailed alternative world . . . <em>Zone 23</em> has a place on a list of several classic dystopian novels that have taken on similar themes.""<br /><strong>—V. N. Alexander, <em>Dactyl Review</em></strong> <h5 style=""padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 16px;"">An Excerpt from <em>Zone 23</em></h5> <p>At approximately 0530 o’clock on the morning of officially 17 April, 2610, H.C.S.T., or 02 Iyyar, 6370, or 01 Shawwal, 2049, or Day 600 in the Year of the Lemur, throughout the Residential Communities of Northeast Region 709, having finished their normal morning ablutions, waterless showering, laser body shaving, anal bleaching, and other ablutions, and having broken the seals on the recyclable containers of their anti-oxidant soy-milk smoothies and lowfat totally gluten-free breakfasts, the Normals and their families were gathered together in their temperature-regulated, self-cleaning kitchens, their heads slightly bowed in an attitude of prayer, scanning, each on their All-in-One Viewers (or their MultiMax Viewers, or Mondo Viewers, or whatever brand of Viewer they were viewing), their personally-programmed proprietary streams of individualized Morning Content, a lively mix of information, entertainment and social messaging customized to reflect their interests and individual purchasing patterns.</p> <p>The forecast that morning was particularly pleasant, clear and sunny throughout the Region. Winds were out of the west and light. The projected high was 46C. Heat advisories remained in effect for Communities south of the 45th parallel. Consumers were advised to refrain from any non-essential outdoor activity.</p> <p>Everything else was looking rosy. SatCom signal strength was excellent. Check-in times at the local airports were averaging under fourteen hours, down from their previous eighteen hours, down from their previous twenty-two hours. The odds of a devastating Terrorist attack with an improvised low-yield nuclear weapon, or some horrible chemical or bio-agent that would kill you the second it touched your skin, were low to acceptable.</p> <p>Life was good.</p> <p>Business was good. Extremely good. Little green upward-pointing arrows were dancing across the bottom of their screens. They were chasing a parade of little three-letter acronyms, each of which stood for some corporate entity, all of whose shares were trading heavily.</p> <p>Normal consumers could track this trading, in Real-Time, right on the screens of their Viewers, or download individualized streams of market data from selected Regions. Or they could visit these Regions on their Real-Life maps, search nearby for business establishments, zoom right into their virtual interiors and virtually experience their virtual environments. Or they could search for Entertainment Content in which these business establishments were featured, or the names of which were casually mentioned, household names like Chloe’s, Chaney’s, VR Universe and Big-Buy Basement, where every GMAX Model 30, whatever that was, was drastically reduced. Or they could comparison shop at CRS, Big-Buy Basement’s fiercest competitor, which would match or beat Big-Buy’s best price on any approved prescription medication. Cylozilatrin Z, for example, a popular Amyloidosis preventative, or Xtra-strength Buxafenanadrine Plus, which reduced the adverse effects of something. And that wasn’t all, oh no, far from it, because the Normals were free to share this offer, the conditions of which were subject to change, with their Big-Buy Family, Friends &amp; Contacts, some of whom were bound to be fans of Brandon Westwood, the Content designer, whose latest interactive Immersion, <em>The Magical Journey of Thilo and Tammy</em>, had just won a Golden Penguin in Gothåb, where currently it was 18 Celsius and partly cloudy with scattered light showers, and to which last-minute round-trip tickets were being offered at the following portals . . . which millions of Normals were actually doing, or were seriously considering contemplating doing (i.e. sharing this offer with their Friends &amp; Contacts, or checking out last-minute flights to Gothåb, or searching to find out where that was, assuming it was somewhere that actually existed), when the peace of the cherished quality time they were spending with their families that morning, or the fugue state they were all gradually entering, was shattered by an all caps BREAKING NEWS message.</p> <p>The news was bad. Extremely bad. Jimmy “Jimbo” Cartwright, III, founder and CEO of Finkles, had, apparently, lost his battle with complications of intestinal cancer, and had died at the age of one hundred and thirty. The actual message read as follows:</p> <p> </p> <p><em>CANCER SCOURGE CLAIMS FINKLES JIMBO! </em></p> <p> </p> <p>Now this kind of thing didn’t happen all that often. In the Age of the Renaissance of Freedom and Prosperity, given the rather staggering cost of intra-provider coordination, and the corresponding loss of advertising revenues, these multi-platform BREAKING NEWS messages were normally reserved for horrible accidents, or catastrophic weather events, or the thwarting of some devastating Terrorist attack by one of the corporate Security Services. The death of a single individual, even an extremely important individual, like a CEO, or COO, or the head of some Info-Entertainment conglomerate, newsworthy though it may have been, hardly warranted interruption of the constant flow of Info-streams upon which the global economy depended and to which most of the Normals’ eyes were glued at every waking moment.</p> <p>But Jimmy “Jimbo” Cartwright, III, was not just any important individual. No, “Jimbo” was a larger-than-life individual, an embodiment of the spirit of the age, a shining symbol of all that was good and right in the world in the 27th Century. In addition to his bold and steadfast leadership of Finkles and the Finkles Family of Companies, and his tireless philanthropic activities, and generally serving as a living beacon of dauntless entrepreneurial vehemence, interdependent market fervor, and freedom, and, well, an inspiration to all, he was one of the shrewdest large investors in the annals of public and private equity whose every random homespun utterance was parsed for meaning like Delphic prophecy. A quadrillionaire by the age of forty, with luxury condos and country estates in the most exclusive Communities in the North, where he hosted extravagant V.I.P. galas for A-List celebrities and the super-abundant (a limited selection of photos of which were sold to consumers and traded avidly), and being just unimaginably wealthy, and this quasi-Arthurian father-type figure whose face you saw like twelve times an hour beaming secret enlightened wisdom down at you out of some virtual screen, the news of his tragic and untimely death was a crushing emotional blow to the Normals, many of whom felt like they were facing the loss of a much loved member of their personal families.</p> <p>People broke down and wept in their smoothies. They choked on their antioxidant fruit bars. Those with irritable bowel syndrome shuffled, or kind of crab-walked their way, to the nearest available waterless toilet. Families joined hands at their breakfast tables and recited prayers and affirmations. Networks interrupted programming. Servers flooded with Fleeps and Tweaks. Luminaries were reached for comment.</p> <p>All this went on for several minutes.</p> <p>Once the initial shock had worn off, and the heartbreaking news of the death of “Jimbo” had been moved down to the headline creeper that ran at the bottom of everyone’s screen, and the various medications they were taking, the doses of which they had immediately increased, had upped their serotonin levels, and bound to their benzodiazepine receptors, flooding their brains with a mild but measurable sense of inner peace and well-being, the Normals went back to consuming their breakfasts, and to scanning their individualized streams . . . sad, yes, definitely sad, deeply sad (very, very sad), but not in any debilitating, or excessive, or self-indulgent way that might have negatively affected their performances at work (which they knew were being continually monitored) or caused anyone to feel uncomfortable, because deep down, in addition to the meds they were on, they just knew in their hearts (and they reminded themselves on a daily basis with their affirmations), that the sadness they were feeling was just a feeling, a feeling that would eventually pass, and that all they had to do was detach from the feeling, and try not to label or judge the feeling, or the painful event that had triggered the feeling, because everything, even painful events, like the tragic and untimely death of “Jimbo,” or even just frightening and horrible facts, like the scourge of aggressive intestinal cancer, or colon cancer, or prostate cancer, or malignant melanoma, or frontotemporal dementia, or the more or less constantly imminent threat of a sudden and devastating Terrorist attack, or catastrophic weather event, or some other type of horrible accident . . . all of it, everything under the sun, no matter how frightening, or depressing, or horrible, was part of some perfect, ineluctable, convoluted cosmic plan, or story, or evolutionary process, or had something to do with the concept of progress, and anyway they were due at work, and the BREAKING NEWS message was gone from their Viewers, which were streaming and fleeping and tweaking again and . . .</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SunWInIdL._SL1500_.jpg
