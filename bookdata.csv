Haiku: The Last Poems of an American Icon,Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,Richard Wright,Paperback,Arcade,"February 1, 2012",978-1611453492,"<p>Richard Wright’s <em>Haiku: The Last Poems of an American Icon</em> reads like a heavyweight who’s slipped out of the spotlight and into a small Paris room to practice disappearing. The introduction tells us these poems were written during his French exile, in the last eighteen months of his life—scribbled everywhere, at all hours, the notebook practically glued “under his arm.” The result is intimacy with a knife-edge: three lines, then a blackout.</p><p>One early haiku is the mission statement: “I am nobody: / A red sinking autumn sun / Took my name away.” The book keeps returning to weather and creatures—gulls, magnolias, sleet, crows, spiders—yet the real habitat is the mind under pressure: illness, grief, politics, the sense of being monitored, the body doing its humiliating little vaudeville. The discipline of the form (“always five, seven and five,” his daughter remembers) becomes a daily containment spell, a way to make terror fit in the palm.</p><p>The editors note this is a selection—817 poems out of roughly four thousand—and it plays like an expertly cut reel: abrupt tenderness, sudden dread, then a wry shrug that somehow counts as mercy. You finish it hearing the world louder, but needing fewer words</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-vySSqu3L._SL1500_.jpg
Haiku: The Last Poems of an American Icon,Recommended Books,Book of the Week,Richard Wright,Paperback,Arcade,"February 1, 2012",978-1611453492,"<p><em>Haiku: The Last Poems of an American Icon </em>includes over 800 haiku by Richard Wright, one of the early forceful and eloquent spokesmen for black Americans, author of the acclaimed <em>Native Son</em> and <em>Black Boy</em>. Wright discovered the haiku in the last eighteen months of life. He attempted to capture, through his sensibility as an African American, the elusive Zen discipline and beauty in depicting man’s relationship, not only to his fellow man as he had in the raw and forceful prose of his fiction, but to the natural world.</p><h5 style=""padding-bottom: 5px;border-bottom: 1px solid #000;margin-top: 25px;margin-bottom: 16px"">An Excerpt from <em>Haiku</em></h5><p>1.</p><p>I am nobody:</p><p>A red sinking autumn sun</p><p>Took my name away.</p><p> </p><p>2.</p><p>For you, O gulls,</p><p>I order salty waters</p><p>And this leaden sky!</p><p> </p><p>3.</p><p>Keep straight down this block,</p><p>Then turn right where you will find</p><p>A peach <p> </p><p>4.</p><p>Sweep away the clouds</p><p>And let a dome of blue sky</p><p>Give this sea a name!</p><p> </p><p>5.</p><p>I give permission</p><p>For this slow spring rain to soak</p><p>The violet beds.</p><p> </p><p>6.</p><p>Follow wherever</p><p>The tree branches make arches</p><p>In the torrid sun.</p><p> </p><p>Make up your mind, Snail!</p><p>You are half inside your house,</p><p>And halfway out!</p><p> </p><p>8.</p><p>O finicky cat,</p><p>Forgive me for this spring rain</p><p>That Disgusts you so!</p><p> </p><p>9.</p><p>Steep with deep sweetness,</p><p>O You White Magnolias,</p><p>This still torpid night!</p><p> </p><p>10.</p><p>“Shut up, you crickets!</p><p>How can I hear what my wife</p><p>Is saying to me?”</p><p> </p><p>11.</p><p>You moths must leave now;</p><p>I am turning out the light</p><p>And going to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>12.</p><p>“Oh, Mr. Scarecrow,</p><p>Stop waving your arms about</p><p>Like a foreigner!”</p><p> </p><p>13.</p><p>I would like a bell</p><p>Tolling in this soft twilight</p><p>Over willow trees.</p><p> </p><p>14.</p><p>I grant to sparrows</p><p>The telegraph wires that brought</p><p>Me such good tidings!</p><p> </p><p>15.</p><p>O Anvil, be beaten,</p><p>Bear all the bitter blows till</p><p>The Spring sun goes down!</p><p> </p><p>16.</p><p>All right, You Sparrows;</p><p>The sun has set and you can now</p><p>Stop your chattering!</p><p> </p><p>17.</p><p>In a misty rain</p><p>A butterfly is riding</p><p>The tail of a cow.</p><p> </p><p>18.</p><p>Sparrow’s excrement</p><p>Becomes quickly powdery</p><p>On sizzling pavements.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>19.</p><p>A summer barnyard:</p><p>Swishing tails of twenty cows</p><p>Twitching at the flies.</p><p> </p><p>20.</p><p>The dog’s violent sneeze</p><p>Fails to rouse a single fly</p><p>On his mangy back.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-vySSqu3L._SL1500_.jpg
