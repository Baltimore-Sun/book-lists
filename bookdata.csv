It had been so long since he just relaxed and read a book for pleasure.</p> <p>The array of messages and platforms assaulted and confused the brain, whichalready had its own inborn voices and perspectives—its own war- ring hemispheres.Modern people could only strive to retroactively make meanings out of scatterings, to fusehurried improvisations into music, he thought. It was sad.</p> <p>Dan resented the working conditions of cognitive labor, of content creation: 24/7 focus, one hundred percent response-rate; omnipresence was the expectation on socialmedia (which was torture). He wanted a place for order, solitude, contemplation, self-effacement; he used to go to The Cloisters on the weekends, but he’d stopped doing thatseveral years ago.</p> <p>It had become impossible for an English professor to find time to think or readdeeply: the irony did not escape him.</p> <p>A dumbness rose through his brainstem like sap. When was the last time he felt trulyawake? When was the last time he felt like he inhabited the body that carried him fromplace to place, day to day?</p> <p>The kitchen was stubbornly warm. He hated how September nights no longercooled down like they had in his youth.</p> <p>What the body could sense the brain denied. Human cognition wouldn’t act on thesense-data of climate change. That was asking too much. All connection to the mytho-poetic parts of consciousness had been severed. Equinox, solstice: these vitally importantdays passed by without anyone noticing.</p> <p>If the sea rose, the place he was living right now would be under water.</p> <p>He concentrated on the white spots on his fingernails, bit his knuckle, looked downat the table, at his feet, the floor, as if he were trying to push his eyeballs out of his skull,into the pit of the earth.</p> <p>He started to think about the $250 check he’d get for whatever he came up with; atworst, he could write something for The Chronicle of Higher Education blog about solitude(or something like that)—the tragedy of distraction and wasted mental energy.</p> <p>Yet another voice told him that the important thing, now, after midnight, was to beproductive: to use these hours of forced awakeness, to convert sleep into verbiage, to be amachine. Dan began to type:</p> <p>There is one political question which cuts across class, race, epoch: what to do withunemployed young men? There is no part of the country—really, no place on earth—wheremale youths are not alienated and disaffected, and therefore dangerous. There is no placewhere there is any clear answer to the question about what it means to ‘ be a man’—and noplace where there is any agreement about whether that question is even worth asking.</p> <p>He trailed off, bored by the sound of his own “voice.”</p> <p>There was a dog-eared copy of Henry James’s <em>The Ambassadors</em> on top of thetoaster; he reached for it, but then stopped himself.</p> <p>He’d written about James in his first book (which had been based on his thesis). Ithad been blurbed by three of his mentors, received perfunctory reviews in two minorjournals, and that was it.</p> <p>University of Chicago Press. The name still gave him pleasure, even if the press hadn’t really met his expectations. His next book would be with Verso and there was already a contract. Verso understood what he was about. A radical writer deserved aradical press.</p> <p>Dan spent a lot of time reading comments on his old articles. He was completelyinvested in the world, the world of argument and counterargument, the thinking thatsurrounded the think piece, the chatter that grew, centrifugally, around the dim signal of hisideas. Chatter was better than silence: it told him that he was relevant.</p> <p>He considered topics. Capital? Equality? Bernie? These were generalities, but theyseemed incredibly fertile, charged with potential. The cognitive effect of the word “capital”was profound: he could feel his brain activate, neurons start to swim.</p> <p>Dan wanted to write about hypertrophied, steroidal digital capitalism: the glossy,muscular, unstoppable flows of capital that coursed through smartphones.</p> <p>The irony was that Dan wanted to sell books and academic publishers wantedleftists who could sell books. He wanted to turn his thinking into information and sell it justlike everyone else. He dreamed about quitting teaching, or getting more money for teachingless (a bigger apartment too) and getting a Tesla.</p> <p>Dan imagined driving to a house in the Hudson Valley with Mariko on Fridayevenings; he imagined weekends with vintage wines, farm foods, little gatherings ofintellectuals around a fireplace to talk about ideas and events. It was within reach.</p> <p>Why has America self-fashioned as a Christian nation, when it is, in fact, an anti-Christiannation: conditioned to hate the poor, the meek, the powerless? The American right is simplyAmericanism taken to its logical extreme: the hatred of those who symbolize the ignominyof the $ sign—those who lack it. What unites the Trump and Ryan (the usual alliance ofemperors and opportunists) factions is this, this instinctual hate-lust of the poverty-Other.Christian love pulled inside out.</p> <p>His ideas, organically expressed, were gnomic and aphoristic. He’d fought this tendency hisentire academic career, going back to his first under- graduate English paper. He’d been athis most original then, freshman year, when he didn’t know how to write, and really didn’tknow how to do anything except argue with himself, with his own instincts. He wrote byhand on yellow legal pads that he’d stolen from his father’s office.</p> <p>He was a virgin then, too.</p> <p>Those were his two dominant memories of the first year at Brown: his crazy,aphoristic papers and his determination to lose his virginity without revealing that he was,indeed, a virgin.</p> <p>Had he always been trying to deceive other people about who he was? And if so,why? Why couldn’t he let himself be seen? What was he afraid of?</p> <p>This higher-level thought, or self-criticism, never really went away: it was theshadow cast by the quarter-truths with which he constructed his persona. It was so easy tocontinue as if there was no shadow, as if the quarter-truths were whole-truths. </p> <p>He’d been in therapy for years—since graduate school. He needed to talk: for hoursand hours, for years and years.</p> <p>The basic position of psychoanalysis was a deeply empowering one. It provided Danwith the space to map his inner-landscape. Therapy gave him the courage to explore theshame which had compacted and crystallized within himself (which he located just belowhis sternum and slightly above his pubic bone—the node in which all his lived experiencewas stored like fat).</p> <p>He slipped his left hand under his shirt and rubbed this area, the skin beneath hisnavel, with his thumb, stroking, directly above his bladder, with his fore- and middle-fingers. He did this unconsciously, finding in three-dimensional space that area that he hadlocated mentally, in two-dimensional space.</p> <p>He kept typing, as if in a trance.</p> <p>We need to get rid of the idea that we have a life just because we’re alive. Nothing could be less true. Nothing could be more antithetical to the spirit of life, in fact, medieval peasants only labored about five hours a day . . . and that much of the calendar was taken up with holidays. Culturally, we have created the narrative of progress, in order to justify adecreasing average quality of life—in order to justify the horror of monotonous office work.</p> <p>We have longer, richer lives than ever before—according to the measurements invented byeconomists and politicians. But how much time do we spend in celebration? In the sun? Inthe fields and trees? How much time do we spend together?He stopped, briefly touching his cock in an homage to Balzac (who never wrote flaccid) and continued:</p> <p>American fascism: the restoration of the pride of the American male via association withDonald Trump’s outrageous phallus. The devotion of the laborer to the capitalist.</p> <p>The professor flicked over to Facebook, interrupting his writing, as if his brain had said, in effect, “enough for now.” Even late into the night, there was an almost audible hum of activity on Twitter and Facebook: likes, comments, news.</p> <p>The whole world was being funneled through social media—refracted. Dan’s mindmelded with the hive-mind; the hive-mind melded with Dan.Sputterings of melancholy and nostalgia. The faces of people he would never meet or never meet again.Time escaped in strange ways, excusing itself like a guest at a party, never really saying goodbye, shutting the door before he could say goodnight; in the hyper-fragmentedtime of the screen, time was itself a kind of ghost: a hallucination in which you sense thatyour material, embodied life has continued on without you.</p> <p>He looked at one of the “stickies” on his desktop:</p> <p>Marx compares bourgeois society to a sorcerer who can no longer control the powers of theunderworld. Possible book topic. But somebody must be writing that book: the book about the transformation of mind intodigital-matter. The collectivization of opinion.The algorithmization of consensus.Someone a lot smarter than me. The ultimate (and yet banal) taboo of digital capitalism: that it forces us to exploit eachother.</p> <p>Suddenly: a Facebook message, announced by a waterdrop sound. hey what’s what up?</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81cECPrd4AL._SY342_.jpg
