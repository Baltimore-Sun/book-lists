Saying Yes: My Adventures in Polyamory,Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,Natalie Davis,Hardcover,Skyhorse,"January 13, 2026",978-1510784499,"<p>Everything old is (internet) news again. It’s a comfort to know that the vagaries of human nature don’t change—the words do. Boomers called it swinging; Millennials dress it up as polyamory, or, the sinfully heinous mock-Kinseyan phrase “ethical non-monogamy.” This throaty, kaleidoscopic, <em>normative </em>memoir by Natalie Davis is a Baedeker’s banquet: <em>Everything You Wanted to Know About Throupling But Were Too Aroused to Ask</em>.</p><p>Natalie’s husband has an affair then agonizes over the pain that it’s caused her. His solution is (drum roll)—that other sinfully heinous word, <em>transparency. </em>Poly wants a cracker! Natalie/Alice reluctantly agrees and as it happens, goes down the greased rabbit hole, changes (many) lobsters, and dances like an mf. (The first and last letters of MILF.) Why hasn’t Netflix or anyone done a <em>smart </em>non-doc non-monogamy series? Like, Nowsville. The steamy, hydra-headed options need to be optioned. To paraphrase the famous quote from <em>Being There, </em>it’s something I’d like to watch. <em>Saying Yes: My Adventures in Polyamory </em>not only rules, it breaks the rules, then makes the rules fun again. Read it out loud with your partner in bed: swap chapters.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f8x+76LGL._SL1500_.jpg

At a little after ten on a Sunday morning, there was just ugh time before my gym class for a quick bite and, yes, coffee. My husband was making breakfast. Breakfast à la Eric was scrambled eggs, a bagel with cream cheese and lox, lightly pulped orange juice, and sugary instant cinnamon-flavored coffee from a tin. The drip coffee was for me, prepared by my husband’s girlfriend. She brewed it stronger than I did, but I liked it. I especially liked that it was being made for me while I slept in the spare room.</em></p><p><em>I leaned sideways in the bed. “Babe,” I whispered to my lover, “Eric is making breakfast. Are you hungry?”</em></p><p>* * *</p><p>Ten years into our marriage, Eric said, “I know what I want for my birthday.” Eric and I met in college. He was a skinny twenty-year-old with dark hair.</p><p>Just shy of six feet tall, he wore large, round, black-framed glasses, typical of the 1980s. In the seventeen years that had brought us to that day, before and after marriage and the birth of our son, I had always agonized over what to get Eric for his birthday.</p><p>“Oh yeah?’ I asked. “What?”</p><p>“I’m going to pull up a website. Please keep an open mind and read it all.</p><p>Then we can talk about it.”</p><p>I looked at my husband. In his mid-thirties then, Eric was still slender, but after becoming a dedicated gym member, he had achieved a more muscular build. That mattered to him. I liked the way he looked and the way he felt against me, with or without the harder pecs. Neither of us had changed much since college. I wore my straight, dark hair in a short bob rather than the midback-length style I had sported when Eric and I met. I had lobbed my locks soon after we started dating because, at nineteen, I yearned to look older. Eric was short-haired and clean-shaven, as befitted the National Guardsman he had been since he was seventeen. He had recently made the Army his full-time career in a headquarters posting.</p><p>I was still within a respectable distance of my college sophomore figure. Eric’s roommate had teased him that we looked disturbingly like siblings with our dark hair and eyes, generous noses, and similar body types. A dozen years after we met, it was no surprise that our son Will was born long and lanky with such deep brown eyes that you had to look closely to discern his pupils. No mischievous blond Calvin for us, even though our looks mirrored those of his comic strip parents, and one of Will’s favorite stuffed animals was a floppy striped tiger. The website for “The Lodge” listed no physical address. The home page advised that directions would be provided after signing in. I raised an eyebrow and read on. There was a dance floor, buffet, bar, pool tables, and private and group rooms. Rules were listed. <em>No means no. Always ask permission. </em>What?</p><p>You guessed it, or maybe not, because it certainly took me a moment. The Lodge was a nightclub for swingers, a term that made me cringe. “Lifestyle club” was the alternative lingo. From what I understood about such places—from movies, I supposed—couples, who might or might not already know each other, swapped partners and had sex.</p><p>The site was low-key. It had FAQs and photos of the club. My brow may have been knitted, but I was still reading. “Okay,” I said, sighing only slightly. “I finished reading.” I swiveled slowly on the desk chair and looked at Eric, my arms crossed over my chest. <em>This should be good.</em></p><p>“I’d like to try this,” he said. “We don’t have to do anything other than check it out, but I’m curious.” He spoke slowly and deliberately as if to avoid spooking a skittish colt. “I realize this is new, but I ask that you try to keep an open mind. That’s all.”</p><p>I felt my face redden and my heartbeat quicken. I was fighting off anger, not successfully. “Strangers hook up and swap partners in the middle of nowhere at someplace called The Lodge? That’s what you want to do on your birthday? And you want me to do it with you? Seriously?” I groaned. “Eric . . . I don’t know. . . .”</p><p>Eric waited.</p><p>I was quiet, thinking. Eight months earlier, Eric had had an affair. As far as I knew, it was the first time he had cheated. Will had been a toddler. Eric’s business had been struggling, and I had just lost my job. Eric’s only income for months had been his three-way cut of the five-bucks-a-head door charge at a weekly goth club he promoted. That’s where he met Katrina<em>. That slut with the bad haircut </em>was how I referred to her in my head when I learned, after Eric answered each question in my cross-examination—the consequence of marrying a lawyer—that he was not her first rodeo with a married man.</p><p>While job hunting on our shared computer, I had happened on an email from her, carelessly left open. Shaking with hurt, anger, and above all, humiliation, I called Eric at work. “I saw the email. Do you think I’m stupid?” I had hung up and paced, considering my options. Eric had rushed home.</p><p>I witnessed Eric crying for the first time. Over the next weeks, we talked a lot. We each found new jobs within a month. There were a lot of transitions for us as individuals and as a couple. We were still recovering the summer Eric made his birthday proposal.</p><p>Eric had risked his family for the validation he found in Katrina’s bed. I was not fool enough to believe his needs had evaporated when the affair ended. I viewed Eric’s openness in proposing this exploration with me as better than cheating. When we talked about his affair, Eric had said that the lying had torn him up.</p><p><em>Oh, poor baby. Was that hard for you? Shall I weep for your angst and your struggle?</em></p><p>“I hated lying to you. I felt dirty and knew you deserved better than that,” he had said. “In my mind—perhaps it was just a fantasy—I had hoped that somehow this could have worked out, that you would see what I saw in Katrina and that you would have been friends because, although I know that you don’t want to hear this now, you two have a lot in common.”</p><p>I had cut my eyes at him. “Except that she had an affair with a man who had a wife and a small child, and I didn’t and wouldn’t. You know, except that<em>.</em>”</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f8x+76LGL._SL1500_.jpg
