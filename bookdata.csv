A harbinger of things to come, that was still a kinder, gentler time—before headline colleges disinvited speakers for “not directly addressing student concerns regarding racial issues and transphobia” or being “anti-liberal” (a Black professor) or “antifeminist” (a female social critic). Stuart N. Brotman, our leading public scholar on free expression, makes sense out of this senseless, upside-down, Orwellian era, where free speech and thought are suppressed in the very name of free speech and thought. As America 250 celebrations begin, Brotman’s thoughtful exegesis of our times illuminates the inevitable, essential conclusion: “All God’s children get free speech.”</p>",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17zuVPWAFV4EFit2fUfRv__8mDkfSkv87

And increasingly, that answer isn’t as clear as it used to be.</p><p>From newsrooms to classrooms, from corporate boardrooms to kitchen table conversations, Americans are grappling with unprecedented challenges to free expression. The twin pillars of democracy—free speech and free press—face pressure from all directions: government officials seeking to control narratives, tech platforms making content decisions, activists demanding accountability, and citizens caught in the crossfire.<br /> <br /> <strong>The New Reality of Restricted Expression</strong></p><p>Consider what’s happened just in recent years: university presidents have resigned over campus speech controversies. Major social media platforms have banned sitting political figures. Journalists face lawsuits, death threats, and government investigations at record levels. Comedy shows self-censor to avoid controversy. Students report being afraid to speak up in class discussions.</p><p>This isn’t the America the founders envisioned when they crafted the First Amendment’s forty-five words. But it’s the America we inhabit today—one where the right to speak and report freely requires constant defense.</p><p>However, as the Freedom Forum noted in its 2025 report, <em>Where America Stands, </em>“Americans are increasingly divided—not on whether the First Amendment matters, but on what it means, who it protects and how far its guarantees should go.<br /> <br /> <strong>Defining Democracy’s Future</strong></p><p>The digital age has fundamentally changed how we communicate, consume information, and engage with each other. Social media platforms have more power over expression than any government in history. Traditional journalism struggles with new economic models while facing attacks on its credibility. Academic institutions wrestle with balancing free inquiry against calls for trigger warnings and safer spaces.</p><p>These aren’t just policy debates—they’re questions that affect your daily life. Can you share your honest opinion at work? Should your children’s school library carry certain books? How do you know what news sources to trust? When does criticism become harassment?<br /> <br /> <strong>The Stakes Have Never Been Higher</strong></p><p>Free speech and press freedom aren’t mere constitutional niceties—they’re the operating systems of democracy. When they break down, everything else follows. Authoritarian leaders always begin by attacking the press and silencing dissent. Democratic societies thrive when citizens can speak openly, and journalists can report without fear.</p><p>But protecting these freedoms isn’t just the government’s job. It’s everyone’s responsibility. And that means understanding not just what these rights protect, but how they work in practice—and what happens when they don’t.</p><p>The challenge isn’t merely defending expression from government censorship anymore. It’s rebuilding a culture that values vigorous debate and reporting, tolerates offense, and understands that democracy depends on citizens willing to engage with ideas they find uncomfortable or wrong.<br /> <br /> <strong>Beyond Cancel Culture (2022)</strong></p><p>The term “cancel culture” has become unusually pervasive in recent years. It’s even reached the Vatican Diplomatic Corps, which includes representatives from the 183 countries accredited to the Holy See. There, the late Pope Francis said, “Cancel culture is invading many circles and public institutions. As a result, agendas are increasingly dictated by a mindset that rejects the natural foundations of humanity and the cultural roots that constitute the identity of many people.”<br /> <br /> <strong>What Cancel Culture Really Represents</strong></p><p>Today, cancel culture has largely been reduced to a label affixed to any call for someone or something to be publicly admonished, typically through social media and its aftermath. It is used by those along all poles of the political spectrum to point out the intolerance of the other side, sometimes even by the government itself.</p><p>But cancel culture is just a symptom of a larger social disease that has been with us since Victorian times, then amped up in the United States as it became incorporated into our American value system. Put simply, the root of cancel culture is an individual’s or group’s need to censor.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Long History of American “Cancellation”</strong></p><p>The recent blockbuster movie <em>Elvis </em>reminds us that cancel culture has been a feature of American life for decades. Many still remember how Elvis Presley’s records were banned from radio stations based on his on-stage gyrations. Ed Sullivan, too, famously canceled any below-the-waist view of Elvis on his popular Sunday night TV show. A national crisis among screaming teenage girls who were not exposed to Elvis’ swinging hips was thus averted, albeit temporarily.</p><p>The arrival of the Beatles didn’t change things much either. When John Lennon sarcastically commented at a news conference that his group was more popular than Jesus, radio stations across the country promptly removed their music and advised that Beatles records be destroyed immediately.<br /> <br /> <strong>The Disco Demolition Warning</strong></p><p>Remember disco music, which became the soundtrack of our lives in the 1970s? All that was needed by the cancel culture warriors of the day was the support of radio shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl, along with Major League Baseball, which organized a highly publicized promotion at Chicago’s Comiskey Park in 1979. There, between a Chicago White Sox–Detroit Tigers doubleheader, a crate filled with disco records was blown up by Dahl on the field. The crowd went wild—an actual riot followed among thousands in attendance, shouting the new cancel culture mantra, “Disco Sucks.”<br /> <br /> <strong>The Deeper Cultural Problem We Must Address</strong></p><p>Similar stories are plentiful in many other areas of popular culture—comic books, movies, TV shows, and stand-up comedy. And this is not a new phenomenon for any of these, either. Everything old seems new again.</p><p>Our current focus on “cancel culture” incorrectly emphasizes <em>cancel </em>instead of <em>culture</em>. Unless and until we come to grips with why some in our society want to impose censorship on others, the cycle is sure to repeat itself many times again, to our collective detriment.</p><p>The desire to silence opposing voices runs deeper than any political moment or social movement. It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how democracy works—the false belief that preventing others from speaking somehow makes our own voices stronger. The opposite is true: a society that tolerates only approved speech inevitably becomes a society where fewer voices are permitted to speak at all.</p>",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17zuVPWAFV4EFit2fUfRv__8mDkfSkv87
