Wings: The Story of a Band on the Run,Recommended Books,,"Paul McCartney, edited by Ted Widmer",Hardcover,Liveright,"November 4, 2025",978-1324096306,"<p><strong>""We made what seemed like an impossible dream come true.""</strong><strong>―Paul McCartney<br /> <br /> </strong>An engrossing oral history of a band that came to define a generation, <em>Wings: The Story of a Band on the Run</em> tells the madcap story of Paul McCartney and his newly formed band, from their humble beginnings in the early 1970s to their dissolution barely a decade later. Drawn from over 500,000 words of interviews with McCartney, family and band members, and other key participants, <em>Wings</em> recounts―now with a half-century's wisdom―the musical odyssey taken by a man searching for his identity in the aftermath of The Beatles' breakup. Soon joined by his wife―American photographer Linda McCartney―on keyboard and vocals; drummer Denny Seiwell; and guitarist Denny Laine, McCartney sowed the seeds for a new band that would later provide the soundtrack of the decade.</p><p>With extraordinary recollections collected by Oscar-winning director Morgan Neville and edited into a genre-defining oral history by Ted Widmer, <em>Wings</em> transports the reader, as if on a magic carpet, to the grit and glamour of the 1970s. Pushing creative forms to produce a new history, even a Wings bible, the book refracts a bygone era in a totally new light. Introduced with a personal, heartfelt foreword by McCartney, the volume contains 150 black-and-white and color photographs, many previously unseen, as well as timelines, a gigography, and a full discography. <em>Wings: The Story of a Band on the Run</em> emerges as a work of soaring originality that presents a new art form all its own.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-lqi0yR3L._SL1500_.jpg

How do we make informed dietary choices for ourselves, our families, and our communities?</p><p>In the twenty years since Marion Nestle’s groundbreaking <em>What to Eat</em> first came out, food has undergone a radical change. The emergence of techno foods, the growth of corporate organics, and a surge of interest in food-delivery services reignited by the pandemic are just a few of the things that have altered how we think about how we eat.</p><p>The typical American supermarket carries more than thirty thousand products. How do you choose? Misinformation, disinformation, and corporate misdirection play a crucial and hard-to-see role in how the average shopper thinks about and chooses food.</p><p>In an aisle-by-aisle guide, Nestle, America’s preeminent nutritionist and a founding figure in American food studies, takes us through the American supermarket. With persistence, wit, and common sense, she establishes the basics of good nutrition, food safety, and ethical and sustainable eating, and gives readers a close-up look at the web of interests―from supermarket slotting policies to multinational food corporations to lobbying groups―that food has to navigate before it gets to your shopping basket.</p><p>Above all else, <em>What to Eat Now</em> is a defense of real food and of the value of eating deliciously, mindfully, and responsibly.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BBp26rg4L._SL1500_.jpg

But underneath all that, he was hiding some of his darkest struggles from the world. Now he is ready to tell his full story.</p><p><em>Episodes</em> is Gucci’s way of reaching beyond the “each one, teach one” approach of discussing mental illness behind closed doors, opting instead to cultivate a discourse amongst a culture that, while steadily improving how it regards mental health, still stigmatizes public discussions around the topic. This compelling memoir sheds light on both his inner struggles and his triumphs, offering an unflinching account of a man who defied the odds to leave a lasting legacy on music, culture, and conversations around mental health.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-ydvRqK8L._SL1500_.jpg

In <em>The Suicides Grave</em>, Hogg weaves an eerie atmosphere of moral reckoning and spectral dread, as the land itself seems to recoil from the sinner buried beyond the church’s grace.</p><p>In this new edition from Arcade Publishing, artist Dmitry Samarov interprets this classic tale through ballpoint pen illustrations, adding new depth to a sorely underread work that explores the themes of religion, morality, and the consequences of actions through the protagonist’s confessions.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lA3p2Z53L._SL1500_.jpg
Dignity Not Citizenship: The Truth About Immigration No One Is Telling You,Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,Maria Elvira Salazar,Hardcover,Regnery,"November 18, 2025",978-1510786561,"<p><em>Dignity Not Citizenship: The Truth About Immigration No One Is Telling</em> <em>You</em> is the newly released purpose driven book tackling immigration by Republican Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar, who represents South Florida—she’s a first-generation American and the daughter of Cuban political refugees.</p><p>On July 15, 2025, a group of representatives led by Salazar and Veronica Escobar (D-TX) introduced an updated version of the DIGNITY Act to fix our nation’s broken immigration system, the first serious bipartisan immigration solution proposed by Congress in decades. When you read this book, you’ll be startled by the audaciously clear and compassionate solution it provides—a <em>solution</em>, rather than a radical, unworkable approach, to a problem that will never go away.</p><p>Salazar’s vision sidesteps both the reckless open-borders policy initiated by the last administration and the over-correction of the current White House. <em>Dignity Not Citizenship</em> gives millions of long-term undocumented immigrants a chance to step out of the shadows, preventing “long-term worker from being deported and allows them to fully and legally participate in the US workforce.” This solution will benefit all Americans, taking what each side of the aisle gets right, and leaving the rest.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aO5kfAHPL._SL1500_.jpg
Dignity Not Citizenship: The Truth About Immigration No One Is Telling You,Recommended Books,Book of the Week,Maria Elvira Salazar,Hardcover,Regnery,"November 18, 2025",978-1510786561,"<p><strong>A BIPARTISAN PATH </strong></p><p>In Washington today, compromise has become a dirty word.</p><p>It is treated almost like a betrayal—finding middle ground means surrender. Our politics mirror a deeply divided nation. Presidential elections are decided by a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states. Everyone has a strong opinion about everything—each side convinced they are right, while the other side is dangerously wrong.</p><p>Immigration is no exception. It is one of the most divisive, emotional, and stubborn issues in our national conversation. And that is exactly why it is also one of the most difficult to solve.</p><p>There is no silver-bullet argument. No one perspective carries the whole truth. Any honest attempt at a solution requires acknowledging that immigration looks different in every corner of the country.</p><p>In Congress, there are 435 districts, each with about 750,000 people, and every representative sees the problem through the lens of the people they serve. An agricultural district sees immigration through the prism of farming and labor. A border district sees it through security. A dense urban district sees it through the human impact—the neighbor, the co-worker, the friend who lives in the shadows.</p><p>Each view is valid in its own context. But each view is incomplete. It is natural for people to focus on the part that affects them most. If you are worried about cartel violence on the border, you are not thinking about berry fields in California. If you are worried about who is picking those berries, you are not thinking about how asylum policy affects Texas. To solve immigration, we have to see the whole picture. It is like a chain of dominoes—push one piece, and half a dozen others fall.</p><p>That is why bipartisanship is not a luxury; it is a necessity. You cannot pass immigration reform with one party or one region forcing its will on the rest of the country. You have to walk people through the problem, show them where past attempts have failed, point out where common ground exists, and explain how each piece fits together.</p><p>Any serious reform must work in a border town, in a farm community, in a tech hub, and on the factory floor. It must speak to Republicans and Democrats alike. And that is why, when it comes to immigration, the real question is not “who’s right and who’s wrong?” but “what does each side get right, and how do we build from there?”</p><p> </p><p><strong>THE DIGNITY ACT</strong></p><p>The world has changed dramatically in the five years since I was elected to Congress in 2020—and in the three years since we first introduced the Dignity Act. A global pandemic that upended lives and economies. The Biden presidency, with its chaos at the border. Wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. And then Donald Trump’s extraordinary comeback and reelection, reshaping American politics yet again.</p><p>Meanwhile, the immigration crisis has not stood still. It has grown more urgent, more pressing, and more impossible to ignore.</p><p>The Dignity Act has evolved too. The version we introduced in July 2025 is not the same bill I brought forward in my first term in Congress. It reflects hundreds of conversations—with border sheriffs, mayors, farmers, business owners, union leaders, independents, Democrats, Republicans, and, most importantly, immigrants themselves. I have listened. I have argued. I have sought compromise where compromise seemed impossible.</p><p>The Dignity Act of 2025 is the product of those disagreements, those debates, and those tough choices. It is a carefully crafted solution to meet the current circumstances. And while it cannot be the perfect solution for everyone, it is the most practical, most durable, and most American path forward that we have seen in forty years.</p><p> </p><p><strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC BILL IN CONGRESS </strong></p><p>We know what happens without immigrants. Within a week, grocery shelves would be stripped bare. New homes would stop rising from the ground. Restaurants, tourism, and travel—cornerstones of American life—would become unaffordable for middle-class families.</p><p>This is not speculation. It is a fact. Millions of undocumented workers are powering these industries, and together, agriculture, construction, and hospitality account for roughly 15 percent of the nation’s GDP. That’s nearly one-sixth of our entire economy held together by people most politicians only talk about in whispers or soundbites.</p><p>Immigration isn’t just immigration. Immigration is economics. Immigration is everything.</p><p>By now, we know what we stand to lose without immigrants.</p><p>If we fail to address and stabilize this dependency—comprehensively and thoughtfully—if we instead embrace the fantasy of mass deportation that hardliners love to promise, the consequences will crash down on all of us. Deport millions of workers overnight, and you won’t just hurt immigrants. You’ll ignite economic shocks that ripple through every sector: higher costs of living, runaway inflation, recession.</p><p>That’s what we stand to lose without immigrants. Here is what we stand to gain—with Dignity.</p><p>The case is straightforward. The Dignity Act is not just good immigration policy. It is the single most important economic bill in Congress today.</p><p>With the growth unlocked by this legislation, we can actually begin to pay down our debt and restore fiscal responsibility— something Republicans have demanded for years but have been unable to achieve.</p><p>The mechanics are clear. The Dignity Act prevents long-term workers from being deported and allows them to fully and legally participate in the US workforce. That means filling urgent gaps in the labor market and capturing the economic benefits of their work through taxes, restitution fees, and growth of our critical industries.</p><p>It’s not just about the present. It’s the future. Through its legal reforms, the Dignity Act also prepares the United States for the next century: advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, financial technology, and cyber defense. These industries will define the next generation of global competition. Without workers—skilled and unskilled—we cannot lead them.</p><p>(By the way, we have not addressed legal immigration yet, but I will do that later in this book.)</p><p>Critics will keep shouting the same lines. “Immigrants are taking jobs. Immigrants lower wages. Deport them, and Americans will do better.” Others argue we can just automate everything. Build machines to replace the workers. Or they suggest that deporting millions will magically solve the housing crisis. They say the economy will absorb the shock. They believe it won’t affect them personally.</p><p>They are wrong.</p><p>The truth is that immigrants fill labor gaps—especially in sectors that native-born workers either cannot or will not fill. And they don’t just work—they spend. They buy food, cars, and clothes. They rent homes, pay tuition, and open businesses. Every dollar they spend fuels demand for goods and services, creating more opportunity for Americans.</p><p>Immigrants grow the pie. They do not shrink it.</p><p>They complement American workers instead of replacing them, filling skill gaps that increase overall productivity. They create jobs rather than taking them. In fact, immigrant-owned businesses hire more employees per capita than businesses owned by the native-born.</p><p>That is not stealing from America. That is building America.</p><p><strong>What’s in it for you? </strong></p><p>The answer is: a lot.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aO5kfAHPL._SL1500_.jpg
