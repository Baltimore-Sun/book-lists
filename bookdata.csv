"I Am Giorgia: My Roots, My Principles",Recommended Books,,"by Giorgia Meloni, Foreword by Donald Trump Jr.",Hardcover,Skyhorse Publishing,"June 17, 2025",978-1510783560,"<p><strong>Do big government debts threaten our collective well-being? Are there limits to debt growth? Can a big, important reserve currency country like the United States really go broke—and what would that look like?</strong><br /> <br /> For decades, politicians, policymakers, and investors have debated these questions, but the answers have eluded them. In this groundbreaking book, Ray Dalio, one of the greatest investors of our time who anticipated the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2010–12 European debt crisis, shares for the first time his detailed explanation of what he calls the “Big Debt Cycle.” Understanding this cycle is critical for helping policymakers, investors, and the general public grasp where we are and where we are headed with the debt issue. Dalio’s model points toward surprisingly straightforward solutions for dealing with the debt problems that the US, Europe, Japan, and China face today.</p> <p><em>How Countries Go Broke</em> also shows how these debt problems are related to the other forces—political within countries, geopolitical between countries, natural (droughts, floods, and pandemics), and technological (most importantly, AI)—that together are causing what Dalio calls the “Overall Big Cycle” changes in the world order. By reading this book, you will improve your understanding of what’s happening now and what to do about it.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71neYSloD+L._SL1500_.jpg

When It All Burns: Fighting Fire in a Transformed World,Recommended Books,,Jordan Thomas,Hardcover,Riverhead Books,"May 27, 2025",978-0593544822,"<p><strong>A hotshot firefighter’s gripping firsthand account of a record-setting fire season</strong><br /> <br /> Eighteen of California’s largest wildfires on record have burned in the past two decades. Scientists recently invented the term “megafire” to describe wildfires that behave in ways that would have been nearly impossible just a generation ago, burning through winter, exploding in the night, and devastating landscapes historically impervious to incendiary destruction.<br /> <br /> In <em>When It All Burns, </em>wildland firefighter and anthropologist Jordan Thomas recounts a single, brutal six-month fire season with the Los Padres Hotshots—the special forces of America’s firefighters. Being a hotshot is among the most difficult jobs on earth. Thomas viscerally renders his crew’s attempts to battle flames that are often too destructive to contain. He uncovers the hidden cultural history of megafires, revealing how humanity’s symbiotic relationship with wildfire became a war—and what can be done to change it back.<br /> <br /> Thomas weaves ecology and the history of Indigenous peoples' oppression, federal forestry, and the growth of the fire industrial complex into a riveting narrative about a new phase in the climate crisis. It's an immersive story of community in the most perilous of circumstances, told with humor, humility, and affection.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-9cEwappL._SL1500_.jpg
For Emma: A Novel,Recommended Books,Bruce Wagner's Pick of the Week,Ewan Morrison,Hardcover,Arcade,"June 17, 2025",978-1648211423,"<p>When his young scientist daughter dies in a covert brain-chip experiment—devoured by the AI “infinity” system—her father goes Luddite: he decides to homemade-bomb the biotech CEO villain to that quaint, soon to be antiquated state of nonbeing: death. As the countdown begins, the grieving, guilt-ridden man gathers courage by making video diaries for his ghostly daughter. The old joke goes that you’re not crazy if you talk to God; you’re crazy if God talks back. Well, the brilliant twist is that Emma starts doing just that. He begins to question (like many of us who, like lemmings, are excitedly bobbing our way toward the black, deep end of the AI pool) if it’s really her or if it’s AI or if he’s going mad. A stylist and a satirist, Morrison uses language that resides in the land of Orwell and pandemic groupthink. Regarding nano-chips, the sunny, pithy phrase is “If you refuse to share, you refuse to care.” Another bit of cleverness: “Plans are underway to launch federal <em>Get Chipped </em>walk-in centers in all states.”</p> <p>The fireworks happen on 10/01, an obvious nod to 9/11. But surely Morrison knew the chilling thing that AI would say about that number (not so obvious):</p> <blockquote> <p>In numerology, the number 1001 is often interpreted as a powerful sign of new beginnings, spiritual awakening, and personal growth, often associated with the guidance of guardian angels.</p> </blockquote> But God is dead. Long live AI.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nMYpCCBRL._SL1500_.jpg

As he must have calculated—or again, been at least dimly aware—that this might be the only time he would ever say such a thing aloud: where it would be, or at least <em>might</em> be, permissible and acceptable in the unmoored profoundness of his misery. All his life, it occurred to me at that moment, Sam had probably been waiting to share this morsel of information, and now he chose to tell all of us at once, in the context of—under the cover of?—his bereavement. Yet I could also tell, as anyone could tell, it was uttered in genuine grief.</p><p>There was a nervous laugh from somewhere in the back row—it sounded to me like Sam’s cousin Morty, who’d been our fourth for golf a few times—but otherwise, everyone remained silent. A rapt silence, certainly. But it would have been a rapt silence anyway, as a man began eulogizing his wife. We would have been attentive anyway, a little anxious, sitting slightly more upright in our pews the moment he took the podium, leaning slightly forward, to see if a man who had just lost his wife, his companion of thirty years, could hold it together enough to say anything at all. To see if Sam—colleague, father, friend—could even begin to speak.</p><p>He patted his maroon tie. He smiled wistfully. “They were so loud, so intense, we’d have to wait until we had complete privacy, until the kids were out of the house.” He glanced apologetically, yet so clearly affectionately, at his three adult children sitting shoulder to shoulder in the front pew. “We’d have to plan our love life around Irene’s orgasms. Their intensity defined our marriage.” He shrugged, almost helplessly, at a fact he’d lived with in dutiful, respectful silence for thirty years, determining that now was the appropriate moment to share it. Maybe he even intended this disclosure to be genuinely helpful in beginning to answer the natural and inevitable question that floats above many of the mourners in this stuffy sanctuary, one that arises naturally in mourning a couple so unceremoniously severed after a lifetime: <em>What was their marriage like?</em> He was actually telling us. Accommodating our idle or prurient curiosity, addressing the vaguely hovering question directly.</p><p>As if people deserved to know. His way of saying <em>This was us</em>. <em>This defined us</em>. As if it would be devious, untruthful, not to share it. This was the time to say it—among family, closest friends. Say it once, have it clearly stated and understood, so no one would ever feel the need to ask any further questions on such a sensitive and private topic.    </p><p>Had he even planned to say it? Or was it extemporaneous, simply what came into his head when he stepped up to the microphone? We’ve all heard eulogies delivered both ways— either read off a sheaf of papers printed out the night before and pulled from a vest pocket or purse, or just arriving at the microphone as if by surprise and saying whatever comes to mind, perhaps too distraught in the aftermath of a death to sit and compose something (or let’s be honest—in many cases too busy, or too lazy). Was Sam simply confident that something important and relevant would occur to him at that moment? Or maybe he simply didn’t care whether anything did or not, didn’t really care what happened up there, or what happened anymore, since the woman in the casket beside him was gone.</p><p>My wife, Sandi, and I were sitting toward the rear, so I could see the shoulders and backs of just about everyone attending, including those of his three children in the first row, his son and two daughters. Apart from his cousin Morty’s snicker behind us, there was no detectable reaction from anyone else. A frozen sea of the aforementioned dark suits and muted dresses, a tableau that didn’t visibly shift one iota. Everyone remained silent. Listening to a eulogy. Pretending it was any other eulogy, or hoping it quickly returned to being so. Hoping that we had misheard, and knowing we hadn’t. Aware now, too, many of us, I’m sure, of our anxious, suddenly accelerating heartbeats.</p><p>“She would scream to high heaven,” he told us. “Every orgasm was like an unanticipated shock, like a new discovery, like landing on some wondrous new shore, and they’d go on and on for, I don’t know, twenty seconds? Thirty? It was something to behold.” He shook his head.</p><p>Sam’s hair had been gone a long time. He’d always been thin, sunken-chested, ever since we met as young associates in tax law at Shepherdson Stern, where we’re both partners today. (Meeting him today, one might assume his build was the result of thirty years bent over tax cases, but I can attest that he arrived this way. Physically preconfigured for tax work.) His chest never filled out his suit jacket. It hung loose, baggy, his slacks, too, disconsolate-looking articles of clothing that themselves always appeared as if they were in mourning: exactly as they hung on him now. Which is all my way of saying that his description of her orgasm, from my sense of it, had nothing to do with conveying his own physical prowess. He was describing it as merely a witness who happened to be there. Happened to be fortuitously present for every one of them.</p><p>“Her body’s arching, and her facial contortions throughout it, Good Lord. Like some kind of demonic possession. But I don’t want to get too graphic, that would be inappropriate, given the occasion.” As if suddenly snapped from his reverie back to the realities and requirements of the moment.</p><p>He spent the next few minutes speaking proudly, appreciatively, and conventionally of Irene’s unwavering competence as a mother, her work fostering service dogs for the deaf, her record of volunteerism on the library board and school board and town council, her easy mastery of Laser-class sailboats, the happy home that she had created and anchored for thirty years. It was a catalogue of her grace and humor and warmth that cheered absolutely no one, from what I could tell, that lifted no hearts, that only magnified the insult of her untimely death and of death in general. It was, however, a catalogue of her special qualities and proficiencies that had the ameliorating effect of making her orgasms sound like just one more in the list of them. The one he’d happened to begin with, yes. But maybe the list was in no particular order. Or maybe it was in that order for every reason in the world.  </p><p>As if it was an effort, conscious or not, to return the eulogy to normalcy. As if to make us all question once more whether we’d heard it accurately to begin with, whether it had really happened. Would any of us remember these other details of Irene’s life of service, of goodness, in light of how Sam had begun? Or would we now remember <em>every</em> detail about her, remember the entire eulogy, as a result? Would her life now especially glow and shimmer before us? Was it the best thing he could do to honor, to commemorate her, to revere Irene’s memory?</p><p> “Gone,” he said, drawing suddenly to a close. And although the word appropriately conveyed a global sense of loss, it was said with such abject mourning, such fresh pain, that it was apparent, to me at least, what he meant, what he was still recounting, what theme he had circled back to. “Gone,” he said again, as if watching his wife’s orgasms disappear down their suburban driveway, head out onto some horizon. “Gone, like her smile, like her Christmas peppermint bark, like her gluten-free peach pancakes, like her fresh-ground coffee, like her smile.” His eyes soaked suddenly, completely, as if in a fresh wash of memory. A man standing before a hundred and fifty of us, utterly alone in his desolation. All of his loving family, his dutiful friends, useless to him.</p><p>He made his way, stooped, depleted, back to the front pew to rejoin his children, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand all the way. . . .
