A Parish Chronicle,Recommended Books,,"Halldór Laxness, translated by Philip Roughton",Paperback,Archipelago,"February 10, 2026",978-1962770514,"<p><strong>From Iceland’s Nobel laureate, an essayistic tale of the unlikely miracles that return a church—fated to disappear over &amp; again throughout time—to the same hillside</strong><br /> <br /> 1882. In the still of morning, Ólafur sharpens his scythe on the bone-dry pavestones that separate his farmhouse from the rest of Mosfell Valley, where life revolves around sheep. The sound of his hammer rings out like a high-pitched bell over the tussocky fields. Across the valley, perched on a hill that hoards more sunshine than others, stands Mosfell Church. Nearby, the parish priest’s maid Gunna pours her “slosh,” a weak cup of coffee. Further afield in Reykjavík (“down south” as the locals say) the general assembly decides to revisit an old plan to cut costs by consolidating small parishes, and calls for the demolition of Mosfell. Yet today a church stands on that same hillside—its sharp steeple silhouetted against the clouds, its crown bell hanging to the left of the altar. In <em>A Parish Chronicle</em>, celebrated novelist Halldór Laxness combs through the minutest details of history—from the location of the ancient burial mound of national hero Egill Skallagrímsson down to the latter part of the 19th century, when weak-sighted Ólafur and bawdy farmhand Gunna will each play an unlikely role in the parish’s stubborn survival. An intimate ode to the way of life in Laxness’s home valley, and a shrewd commentary on how history bends to the quirks of certain individuals—<em>A Parish Chronicle</em> abounds with life.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fWtuYuy6L._SL1500_.jpg
Burning Oracle (Wesleyan Poetry Series),Recommended Books,,Sandra Simonds,Paperback,Wesleyan University Press,"February 17, 2026",978-0819502162,"<p><strong>A fierce, visionary book-length poem</strong><br /> <br /> <em>Burning Oracle</em> is a visionary, book-length poem told from the fractures of a world on fire where myth, memory, and contemporary life collide. Cassandra―seer, mother, survivor―wanders through forests of digital noise and historical trauma, her voice both ancient and urgently new. At the heart of the poem is a pilgrimage to the grave of poet Paul Celan where she traces personal loss within the wider context of inherited trauma―particularly the Holocaust―and seeks meaning in the act of remembering. As floods rise and fires rage, the personal and historical ignite a mythic voice. Through the commonplace of stained dresses, shattered screens, and supermarket aisles, Cassandra encounters figures like Goya, Reynard the fox, and Celan himself, weaving their stories into an intertextual, image-rich landscape. <em>Burning Oracle</em> is a feminist reckoning, a personal mythography, and a testament to the power of poetry to animate the archive of history, memory, and everyday life.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jZELdKUWL.jpg

Told with emotional gravity and stomach-churning detail, Jekielek leaves the reader unable to deny that something must be done—and soon. The transgressions of the CCP can no longer be obscured by the veils of propagandic misdirection: here, they are reified, and they are repulsive.</p><p>Americans aren’t wired to apprehend next-level bureaucratic evil; for too long, it fell into the <em>X-files </em>of UFO abductions and satanic cults. This book brings it into the light, so that readers can see the face of the demon. If you read one nonfiction book this year, let <em>Killed to Order: China's Organ Harvesting Industry and the True Nature of America's Biggest Adversary </em>be the one.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81z3il3zOvL._SL1500_.jpg

She could live in Des Moines, Iowa, or the suburbs of Vancouver, or Manhattan, New York. She could be an attorney, or a stay-at-home mother, or perhaps she’s a sixth-grade science teacher, a job she loves so much she doesn’t even think of it as work. She has a loving husband and two young daughters, eight and ten.</p><p>Her symptoms begin subtly—fatigue, swelling in her ankles and feet, a loss of appetite—then steadily grow more alarming: shortness of breath, nausea, muscle cramps, darkening skin, numbness. After months of doctor’s visits and a battery of tests, she is finally diagnosed with chronic kidney failure.</p><p>Within a couple of years, May’s condition progresses to the point that she requires dialysis three times a week, tethered to machines that perform the work her kidneys no longer can. She is suffering terribly—not only from the pain, exhaustion, and relentlessness of dialysis, but from the sense that she has placed an unbearable strain on her family. At times, it feels as though she has abandoned them. She knows they are doing everything they can to hold things together, but their best no longer feels like enough. Their lives are slowly coming apart.</p><p>A kidney transplant is possible, but only in the distant future. No one even talks about it. The waiting list is measured in years—often two to five, sometimes longer—so long that it feels almost abstract, and impossible to plan around. For now, there is only more of the same: a slow, painful decline in the quality of May’s life, and in the lives of those who love her, and the doctor tells her that less than half of people on dialysis survive to five years. It is enough to make her cry, which she does, quietly, often, and alone.</p><p>One day, while waiting for yet another medical appointment, she overhears a conversation between two women. In low voices, they are discussing something they keep calling “the China option.” May apologizes for eavesdropping, but asks what they are talking about. “What’s the China option?” She would not normally be paying attention, but she’s desperate.</p><p>The two women exchange a look. They explain: quick transplants, no wait times, organs matched very fast. You might make it. You might get to spend many more years with your family. You might not leave them broken and bereaved. For kidneys, at this point, it’s thirty grand.</p><p>“Here,” one of the women says, pulling out a piece of paper. “It’s an ad, but there’s some good information. And a broker’s name.”</p><p>When she tells her family about the conversation, they are elated. It seems too good to be true. Is it really possible? Why hadn’t anyone mentioned this before? Should they do it? It’s a lot of money, but it’s for the family, for the future. Who can put a price on health?</p><p>“It seems risky,” May tells her husband.</p><p>“What do we have to lose?” he asks. “If it works, just think . . . ”</p><p>She doesn’t have to think. All she’s been able to <em>do </em>is think:</p><p>What happens if it works? It would be . . . a miracle.</p><p>“Let’s do it,” she says.</p><p>May calls the number on the ad, speaks to a broker, and they agree to the terms. Though it all seems legitimate and too good to be true, May does not ask too many questions. She is surviving at this point more on hope than anything else. When the money is paid, no receipt is given, only a note that, for all intents and purposes, says nothing.</p><p>The broker arranges everything. Blood samples are sent ahead. Within days, a match is made, and travel arrangements are set. May will fly to China, and the surgery will take place at the Shanghai Number One People’s Hospital. It’s a stark building, far from the bustling street. There is a transplant ward with thirteen rooms, three beds each. Patients come from Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines, Japan, Hawaii—all over the world.</p><p>When she arrives, everything goes according to plan. May is picked up from the airport and travels, in relative comfort, to the facility, where she meets with doctors and nurses. Nothing about it seems remotely suspect, and any concerns she’d been harboring begin to fade.</p><p>The operation will be tomorrow at dawn. May is isolated in a sterile pre-op area. She does have one question, though, which she asks one of the doctors: Who is the kidney coming from? She feels grateful to the donor.</p><p>All she is told is that the kidney will be sourced fresh. She doesn’t ask any more questions.</p><p>Before the operation, cross-matching is done, and the kidney, when it is delivered, is found to be incompatible. The organ can’t be used. It happens, they explain, but not to worry, there are more donors. The next day, another kidney is brought, and this one is a match. The operation lasts about four hours. Four other patients receive their kidneys the same day. May sees them around as she recovers.</p><p>For the next five days, she remains in the hospital under observation. Then another seven in an ordinary room. After about two weeks, May returns home with two souvenirs: her new kidney, which is functioning perfectly, and a small booklet containing information about aftercare. That’s it.</p><p>For a while, she’s constantly reminded of her new kidney, and of the whole strange experience. There’s the recovery, first, and the pain. But then there’s just a scar, which itself fades. In time, she puts the whole experience behind her. She moves on with her life, profoundly grateful to have it.</p><p>But one day she reads a news report that catches her eye. It tells of a woman, a whistleblower, claiming that her surgeon husband has performed thousands of surgeries on Chinese prisoners without their consent. She suddenly feels a sharp pain, a pang of awareness. She remembers something someone told her—maybe the broker, maybe a doctor—that the organs came from death row prisoners. But that’s not what the whistleblower says. She says the organs came from political and religious prisoners, people who practice something called Falun Gong, a spiritual practice persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party with hundreds of thousands of practitioners locked up.</p><p>May’s hands are shaking as she reads on, a terrible thought dawning on her: that someone died—no, that a person was murdered—so that she could live. A wave of nausea hits her. She feels disgusting, violated, guilty, complicit, criminal. She thinks of calling the broker, of demanding answers, but she knows what he will say. And anyway, she’s alive, isn’t she? <em>These things are complicated, </em>he’d told her early on, when she’d asked for a few more details. <em>What matters is the end result: you get to live. For a long, long time.</em></p><p>Yes, she thinks now, but at what cost?</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81z3il3zOvL._SL1500_.jpg
