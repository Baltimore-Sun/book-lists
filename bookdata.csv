Chemtrails—defined by the Oxford dictionary as “a visible trail left in the sky by an aircraft and believed by some to consist of chemical or biological agents released as part of a covert operation”—cf. geoengineering, weather control, biological warfare—are now having a moment that’s far beyond the urban-myth file where they’ve tended to reside. Reading <em>Chemtrails Exposed: A New Manhattan Project</em> reminded me of Edward Snowden’s remark that the real conspiracy theories are the ones that are ""right in front of our eyes.” A rose is a rose is a rose—but a contrail is never a chemtrail. And that’s definitely something to get hung about.</p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71c8FAdcMrL._SL1500_.jpg
Chemtrails Exposed: A New Manhattan Project,Recommended Books,Book of the Week,Peter Kirby,Hardcover,Skyhorse,"January 20, 2026",978-1510785090,"<p><strong>Peter A. Kirby</strong> is a San Rafael, CA researcher, writer, and activist. His research is chronicled on his Rumble show <em>The Abstract</em>, and he provides social commentary on his TruthSocial channel of the same name. He has produced three books so far: <em>Chemtrails Exposed: A New Manhattan Project</em>, <em>From Little Acorns</em>, and <em>The Fall of San Francisco</em>. Among many others, Peter has appeared as a guest on the <em>Corbett Report</em> with James Corbett, <em>Caravan to Midnight</em> with John B. Wells, and <em>Project Camelot</em> with Kerry Cassidy. His work has been translated into every major language.</p><p>“<em>Chemtrails Exposed</em> is an incredibly important book. . . . For decades, the CIA has been involved in climate control. . . . Mr. Kirby's book is the only work that fully exposes this development and the fact that the climate continues to be controlled by a money cartel.”<br /> <strong>–Paul L. Williams, author of <em>Operation Gladio</em> and <em>Killing the Planet<br /> <br /> </em></strong>“I really admire the amount of time and years Peter has dedicated to this. He has collected significant evidence tying elevated levels of toxins like aluminum and barium in rainwater and air samples to geoengineering activities.”<br /> <strong>–Nicole Shanahan, vice-presidential candidate for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in 2024 presidential election</strong></p><h5 style=""padding-bottom: 5px;border-bottom: 1px solid #000;margin-top: 25px;margin-bottom: 16px"">An Excerpt from <em>Chemtrails</em></h5><p><strong>CHEMTRAILS EXPOSED</strong></p><p>According to all relevant United States federal government organizations, chemtrails are a conspiracy theory and do not exist. They say the white lines in the sky stretching from horizon to horizon are normal jet contrails. They add that these emissions are nothing but harmless water vapor. So, they are saying that this water vapor can first appear as white lines high in the sky then, over the course of hours, expand as it floats down to earth; first creating clouds and finally a haze. Folks, that’s not how water vapor behaves. That’s how particulate matter behaves.</p><p>Contrails (not to be confused with chemtrails) are visible jet airplane engine emissions resulting from the combustion of unadulterated fuel. Most of the time, jet airplane exhausts are invisible, but when unadulterated jet engine exhausts are introduced into an atmosphere of high humidity (over 70 percent) and low temperature (below -76 degrees F), a contrail forms. Contrails then quickly (under 5 seconds) disappear.</p><p>Chemtrails are a different animal. Chemtrails are jet airplane emissions which do not quickly dissipate and are not necessarily the product of engine exhausts. They are seen in the sky above our heads on a daily basis. They are the lines in the sky. Your subconscious knows them already. The word “chemtrail” is an amalgamation of the words “chemical” and “contrail.” You could call chemtrails “chemical contrails” or “chemical trails.” The earliest mention of the word “chemtrail” the author could find appears as the title of a 1990 US Air Force Academy chemistry manual. The word “chemtrail” is recognized by the Oxford dictionary. It is defined as, “A visible trail left in the sky by an aircraft and believed by some to consist of chemical or biological agents released as part of a covert operation.”</p><p>The term “persistent contrail” is often used to describe chemtrails, but this term is a politically correct oxymoron which the author uses only to condemn. The term creates confusion. Contrails do not persist. Chemtrails do. The earliest use of the term “persistent contrail” known to the author appears in the 1970 proceedings of the Second National Conference on Weather Modification.</p><p>Lab tests of rainwater samples taken around the world have shown that chemtrails commonly consist of aluminum, barium, and strontium. Further, as we will see in chapter 5, a world-famous PhD scientist has come forward with rock-solid evidence that the substance commonly being sprayed is coal fly ash—a toxic waste.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Oh No, They Wouldn’t!</strong></p><p>Oh yes, they would! Dr. Leonard Cole’s 1988 book Clouds of Secrecy documents our military intentionally exposing unsuspecting United States citizens to chemicals and biologicals hundreds of times. Andrew Goliszek’s illuminating book In the Name of Science provides another examination of our government’s indiscretions. Going back many decades, this book documents megatons of chemical and biological agents ranging from VX nerve gas to zinc cadmium sulfide to bacillus globigii to radioactive iodine to many other substances released onto unsuspecting American citizens in thousands of open-air tests conducted all over the country. Many of these experiments involved the agents being released from airplanes. Governments spray us with toxic chemicals openly. What about cloud seeding with silver iodide? What about the spraying of malathion in the 1980s to save California from the Mediterranean fruit fly, or the more recent light brown apple moth sprayings? Did everybody consent to these actions? In some areas of the country, city works trucks will routinely drive down the street spraying herbicides all over the sidewalk and anyone who might be unfortunate enough to be walking down it. In Florida, large aircraft routinely drop mosquito insecticides over populations without prior consent.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Observations</strong></p><p>A typical chemtrail first appears as a white line high in the sky emitted by a large jet airplane. Chemtrails often form X’s and sometimes grid patterns. Chemtrails are also sometimes sprayed in a circular fashion. These lines become diffuse as they float down to earth. Heavy spraying creates a thick haze over vast areas. Although seemingly endless photos and videos are posted online, you can observe these phenomena with your own eyes. One just needs to look up. Although trolls online try to drag people into highly technical, obscure, and deceptive arguments about the formation of contrails, simple applications of deductive reasoning show that we are being sprayed. When two jet airplanes fly at a similar altitude, why is it that one will emit a persistent trail while the other does not? The fuels are not different. Jet fuel, like gasoline, is standardized. How does a trail appear behind one engine of an airplane, but not the other engine? How does a plane fly along emitting a trail that persists, then abruptly stop emitting a trail, then abruptly start again? It is safe to assume that the engine is not being turned off and on. Why is it that one day the sky will be full of lines in every direction and then the next day there will be none, even though the weather is identical? Why do the lines in the sky often not follow common flight paths? Your author has witnessed all these things, and you can too.</p><p>When they spray above natural clouds, we get a milky sky. Chemtrails sprayed above clouds descend and comingle with the clouds below to cause a loss of cloud definition.</p><p>Chemtrail spray can cause iridescence. Often when they spray, something called a “sun dog” occurs. Also referred to as a 22- or 46-degree halo, a sun dog is a big, rainbow-like halo encircling the sun, although a sun dog’s colors are not as bright as a rainbow’s. You may also see little rainbow segments called “chembows.” Lastly, you may see small, iridescent cumulus clouds. Spraying in general tends to make clouds iridescent, especially around the edges and when backlit by the sun. Chemtrails manifest themselves in many other ways; these are merely the most common and noticeable.</p><p>Coastal areas are seeing a depletion of marine layers. There is a district of San Francisco, California (the author’s hometown), called the Sunset District. Until about 2005, the adjacent Pacific Ocean provided the Sunset District with an almost ever-present blanket of clouds and fog, leaving the area with about five to ten days of sunny weather per year. Now, it is sunny most days in the Sunset District. Due to the hygroscopic (moisture-absorbing) properties of the spray, chemtrail spraying has destroyed the Sunset District’s marine layer. It is safe to assume that chemtrail spraying has caused similar effects along the rest of California’s Pacific Coast as well as desiccation of the state’s interior.</p><p><em>What do you think that does to a native ecosystem?</em></p>",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71c8FAdcMrL._SL1500_.jpg
